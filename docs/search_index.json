VIII.6.B.2.A). Melodic dictation is a cognitively demanding process that requires students to hear a melody, then without any access to an external reference, write the melody down on paper in a limited time frame. As of 2019 there are 644 Schools of Music belonging to National Association of Schools of Music (NASM)1, meaning that thousands of students every year will be expected to learn this challenging task as part of their aural skills education. The implicit logic is that as one improves in their ability to take melodic dictation, this practice of critical and active listening develops one’s ability to “think in music” (Best 1992; Karpinski 2000) and thus become a more competent musician. Despite its ubiquity in curricula within School of Music settings, research that explains how people learn melodies is limited at best. The fields of music theory and cognitive psychology are best positioned to make progress on this question, but often the skills required to be well versed in their of these subjects are disparate, published in separate journals, and the research with overlap is scarce. This problem is not new and there have been repeated attempts to bridge the gap between practitioners of aural skills and people in cognitive psychology (Butler and Lochstampfor, n.d.; Butler 1997; Klonoski 2006, 2000; Pembrook and Riggins 1990; Karpinski 2000). Literature from music theory has established conceptual frameworks regarding aural skills (Karpinski 2000)2, cognitive psychology literature has explored factors that might contribute to melodic perception (Dowling 1990, 1978, 1991; Halpern and Bartlett 2010), and applied literature from the field of music education (Buonviri 2017; Nathan O Buonviri and Paney 2015; Paney 2016). However, despite these isolated areas of research, we as music researchers, do not have an a concrete understanding of exactly what contributes to the process of how individuals learn melodies (Halpern and Bartlett 2010). This is peculiar since “how does one learn a melody?” seems to be one of the fundamental questions to the fields of music theory, music psychology, as well as music education. This chasm in the literature also raises a disconcerting question among pedagogy: If we as pedagogues do not have a in-depth understanding of how people learn melodies, how can we fairly assess what students can be expected to do and then grade them fairly on their attempts? While no single dissertation can solve any problem completely, this dissertation aims to fill the gap in the literature between aural skills practitioners and music psychologists in order to reach conclusions that can be applied systematically in pedagogical contexts. I do this by synthesizing literature from both music theory and music cognition in order to demonstrate how tools from both cognitive psychology as well as computational musicology can be used to help inform pedagogical practices. 1.2 Chapter Overview In this first chapter, I introduce the process of melodic dictation and discuss factors that presumably could play a role in taking melodic dictation building off of the work of Gary Karpinski (Karpinski 2000, 1990) The chapter introduces both a theoretical background and rationale for using methods from both computational musicology and cognitive psychology in order to answer questions about how individuals learn melodies. In order to organize the disparate literature, I put forward a taxonomy of factors that are assumed to contribute to an individual’s ability to take melodic dictation and discuss each in turn. This chapter outlines the factors hypothesized to contribute to an individual’s ability to learn melodies, incorporating both individual and musical parameters. I conclude the chapter with a discussion of some philosophical and theoretical problems when attempting to measure issues concerning melodic dictation and argue for the advantages of answering this problem using a polymorphic view of musicianship (Levitin 2012; Peretz 2006; Baker et al. 2018). The second chapter of my dissertation investigates individual factors that are theorized to contribute to melodic dictation. I argue that since the first two steps of Karpinski’s model of melodic dictation do not require any musical training, teasing apart the individual factors that contribute to melodic dictation can be done using a memory for melodies paradigm and structural equation modeling. I interpret the results of the data and analysis to highlight the importance of working memory processes in melodic dictation. The chapter corroborates claims by Berz (1995) on the importance of understanding differences in working memory capacity and establishes rationale for including it as a variable of interest in future chapters. The third chapter of the dissertation discusses how aural skills pedagogy could benefit from using methodologies computational musicology in order to inform their practice. The chapter begins by establishing the degree to which aural skills pedagogues agree on the difficulty of melodies for melodic dictation using a small survey. I then show how different sets of tools from computational musicology can approximate the intuitions of aural skills pedagogues from the survey. The chapter concludes by putting forward a novel theory of musical memory– The Frequency Facilitation Hypothesis– derived from computational methodologies. I show how this hypothesis can be applied in pedagogical settings to create a more linear path to success in the aural skills classroom among students. In my fourth chapter, I introduce a novel corpus of 783 digitized melodies encoded in the **kern format (Huron 1994). This chapter, encapsulating the encoding process, the sampling criteria, and the situation of corpus methodologies within the broader research area, will go over summary data and also discuss how the corpus could be used to generate hypotheses for future experiments. This dataset will serve as a valuable resource for future researchers in music, psychology, and the digital humanities. In the fifth chapter, I will synthesize the previous research in a series of melodic dictation experiments. Stimuli for the experiments are selected based on the abstracted, computational features of the melodies discussed in earlier chapters and are manipulated as independent variables based on the previous theoretical literature. I then model responses from the experiments using both individual factors and musical features using mixed-effects modeling in order to predict how well an individual performs in behavioral tasks. In discussing the results, I also note important caveats in scoring melodic dictation to discuss similarities between the correct answer and an individual’s attempts at dictation. Results from the final chapter will be discussed with reference to how findings are applicable to pedagogues in aural skills settings. Finally, in my sixth chapter, I introduce a computational, cognitive model of melodic dictation with the goal of helping explain how students improve at melodic dictation. The model is based in research from both cognitive psychology (Cowan 2010) and computational musicology (Pearce 2018) and incorporates relevant theoretical aspects such as working memory (Chenette 2019; VanHandel, Wakefield, and Wilkins 2011) and the structure of the melody itself. In this chapter I demonstrate how modeling the cognitive decision process during melodic dictation helps provide a precise framework for pedagogues to understand student’s inner cognition during melodic dictation and can help inform teaching practice. 1.3 Dissertation Output 1.3.1 Reserach Papers SEM Paper in ICMPC Aural Skills Paper ICMPC Aural Skills Textbook Goldsmiths Replication 1.3.2 Research Presentations SEM Paper at ICMPC Aural Skills Poster Milton Keynes Talk Public Musicology Again and Again?

Melodic dictation is the process in which an individual hears a melody, retains it in memory, and then uses their knowledge of Western musical notation to recreate the mental image of the melody on paper in a limited time frame. For many, becoming proficient at this task is at the core of developing one’s aural skills (Karpinski 1990). For over a century, music pedagogues have valued melodic dictation3 which is evident from the fact that most aural skills texts with content devoted to honing one’s listening skills have sections on melodic dictation (Karpinski 2000). Yet despite this tradition and ubiquity, the rationales as to why it is important for students to learn this ability often comes from some sort of appeal to tradition or underwhelming anecdotal evidence. The argument tends to go that time spent learning to take melodic dictation results in increases in near transfer abilities after an individual acquires a certain degree of proficiency learning to take melodic dictation. Rationales given for why students should learn melodic dictation has even been described by Karpinski as being based on “comparatively vague aphorisms about mental relationships and intelligent listening” (Karpinski 1990, 192), thus leaving the evidence for the argument for learning to take melodic dictation not being well supported. Some researchers have taken a more skeptical stance and asserted that the rationale for why we teach melodic dictation deserves more critique. For example, Klonoski in writing about aural skills education aptly questions “What specific deficiency is revealed with an incorrect response in melodic dictation settings?” (Klonoski 2006). Earlier researchers like Potter, in their own publications, have noted how they have been baffled that many musicians do not actually keep up with their melodic dictation abilities after the class ends (Potter 1990), but presumably go on to have successful and fulfilling musical lives. Additionally, suggesting that people who can hear music and then are unable to write it down, thus are unable to think in music (Karpinski 2000), seems somewhat exclusionary to musical cultures that do not depend on any sort of written notation. Though despite this skepticism towards the topic, melodic dictation remains at the forefront of many aural skills classrooms. The act of becoming better at this skill may or may not lead to large in increases in far transfer of ability, but used as a pedagogical tool, teaching students to take melodic dictation brings with it concepts that have been deemed relevant to the core of undergraduate music training. While there has not been extensive research on melodic dictation research in recent years– in fact Paney (2016) notes that since 2000, only four studies were published that directly examined melodic dictation– this skill set sits on the border between literature on learning, melodic perception, memory, and music theory pedagogy. Understanding and modeling exactly how melodic dictation works remains as a untapped watershed of knowledge for the field of music theory, music education, and music perception and is deserving of much more attention. In this chapter I examine literature both directly and indirectly related to melodic dictation by first reviewing the prominent four step model put forth by Karpinski in order to establish and describe what melodic dictation is. After describing his model, I then critique what this model lacks and clarify what is missing by providing a taxonomy of parameters that presumably would contribute to an individual’s ability to take melodic dictation. Using this taxonomy, I then review relevant literature and assert that the next steps forward in understanding how melodic dictation works come from examing the process both experimentally and computationally. It has been nearly two decades since Aural Skills Acquistion was first published as the first major step to finally build a bridge between the field of music cognition and music theory pedagogy (Butler 1997; Karpinski 2000; Klonoski 2000) and as with all public works, they need to be maintained?4 2.1.1 Describing Melodic Dictation Much of the foundational theoretical work on the topic of melodic dictation comes from Karpinski. Summarized most recently in his Aural Skills Acquisition (Karpinski 2000)– though first presented in an earlier article (Karpinski 1990)– Karpinski proposes a four-step model of melodic dictation.5 The four steps of Karpinski’s model include Hearing Short Term Melodic Memory Musical Understanding Notation and occur as a looping process depicted in Figure 2.1. The model is discussed extensively in both this original article (Karpinski 1990) and throughout the third chapter in his book (Karpinski 2000). Figure 2.1: Karpinski Idealized Flowchart of Melodic Dictation Karpinski’s hearing stage involves the initial perceptions of the sound at the psychoacoustical level and the listener’s attention to the incoming musical information. If the listener is not actively engaging in the task because of factors such as “boredom, lack of discipline, test anxiety, attention deficit disorder, or any number of other causes” then any further processes later down the model will be detrimentally effected. Karpinski notes that these types of interferences are normally “beyond the traditional jurisdiction of aural skills instruction”, but I will later argue that the concept of willful attention, when re-conceptualized as working memory, may actually play a larger role in the melodic dictation process than is claimed here. The short-term melodic memory stage in this process references the point in a melodic dictation where musical material is held in active memory. From Figure 1 it appears that the stage is not conceptualized as an active process where something like active rehearsal would occur, but rather just consists soley of passive mental representation. Though Karpinski does not posit any sort of active process in the short term melodic memory stage, he does suggest there are two separate memory encoding mechanisms, one for contour, and one for pitch. He arrives at these two mechanisms by using both empirical qualitative interview evidece as well as noting literature from music perception that supports this claim for contour (Dowling 1978; Dewitt and Crowder 1986) and literature suggesting that memory for melodic material is dependant on enculturation (Oura and Hatano 1988; Handel 1989; Dowling 1990). Since its publication in 2000, this area of research has expanded with other reearchers also demonstrating the effects of musical acculturation via exposure (Eerola, Louhivuori, and Lebaka 2009; Stevens 2012; M. T. Pearce and Wiggins 2012a). In describing the short term melodic memory stage, Karpinksi also details two processes that he believes to be nesscary for this part of melodic dictation: extractive listening and chunking. Noting that there is probably some sort of capacity limit to the perception of musical material, citing Miller (1956), Karpinski explains how each strategy might be used. Extractive listening is the process in which someone dictating the melody will selectivly remember only a small part of the melody in order to lessen the load on memory. Chunking is the process in which smaller musical elements can be fused together in order to expand how much information can be actively held in memory and manipulated. The concept of chunking is very helpful as a pedagogical tool, but as detailed below, is a complicated concept to pin down how it works. After some musical material is extracted, then represented in memory, the next step in the process is musical understanding. At this point in the dictation the dictator needs to take the extracted musical material that is represented in memory and the use their music theoretic knowledge in order to comprehend any sort of hierarchical relationships between notes, common rhythmic groupings, or any sorts of tonal functions. This is the point in the process where solimization of either or both pitch and rhythm, and musical material might be understood in terms of relative pitch. In the model solimization takes place later, but it is worth questioning if it is possible to dissacociate relative pitch relations from the qualia of the tones themselves (Arthur 2018). For Karpinski, the more quickly what is represented in musical memory can be understood, the more quickly it can then be tranlated at the final step of notation. Notation, the final step of the dictation loop, requires that the individual taking the notation have sufficient knowledge of Western musical notation so that they are able to translate their musical understanding into written notation. This last step is ripe for errors and has proved problematic for researchers attempting to study dictation (Taylor and Pembrook 1983; Klonoski 2006). It is also worth highlighting is that it is difficult to notate musical material if the individual who is dictating does not have the requisite musical category and knowledge for the sounds. Lack of this knowledge will limit an individual’s ability to translate what is in their short term melodic memory into notation, even if it is perfectly represented in memory! The final parts of the chapter, Karpinski notes that other factors like tempo, the length and number of playings, and the duration between playings will also play a role in determining how an individual will perform on a melodic dictation. While this framework can help illuminate this cognitive process and help pedagogues understand how to best help their students, presumably there are many more factors that contribute to this process. The model as it stands is not detailed enough for explanatory purposes and lacks in two areas that would need to be expanded if this model were to be explored experimentally and computationally. First, having a single model for melodic dictation assumes that all individuals are likely to engage in this sequential ordering of events. This could in fact be the case6, but there is research from music perception (Goldman, Jackson, and Sajda 2018) and other areas of memory psychology such as work on expert chess players (Lane and Chang 2018) that suggests that as individuals gain more expertise, their processing and categorization of information changes. Additionally, different individuals will most likely have different experiences dictating melodies based on their own past listening experience, an area that Karpinski refers to when citing literature on musical enculturation based on statistical exposure. The model does not have any flexibility in terms of individual differences. Second, the model presumes the same sequence of events for every melody. As a general heurstic for communicating the process, this process is generalizable, but intuition would suggest that treating all melodies the same is not going to lead to having a robust model. For example, on page 103, Karpinski suggest that two listenings should be adequate for a listener with few to no chunking skills to listen to be able to dictate a melody of twelve to twenty notes. This process might generalize to many tonal melodies, but presumably different strategies in recognition would be involved in dictating the two melodies of equal length shown in Figure 2.2 and 2.3. Figure 2.2: Tonal Melody Figure 2.3: Atonal Melody Presumably different people with different levels of abilities will perform differently on different melodies and while helpful as a pedaogogical tool, this one size-fits-all approach to melodic dictation is not robust. This agnosticism for both variability for melodic and individual differences serves as a stepping off point for this study. In order to have a more through understanding of melodic dictation, there needs to be a model that is able to accomodate the exhaustive differences at both the individual and musical levels. Additionally, the model should be able to be operationalized so that it can be explored in both experimental and computational settings. By explicitly stating variables thought to contribute and noting how melodic dictation works, it will give the community a better sense of the melodic dictation process, which will then enable a more through understanding of melodic perception and subsequently allow for better teaching practices in aural skills classrooms. At this point, it is worth stepping back and noting that the sheer amount of variables at play here is cumbersome and almost haphazard. In order to better understand and organize factors thought to contribute to this process, it would advantagous for future research to taxonomize the multitude of features thought to contribute to melodic dictation. In doing this, it wil allow for a clearer picture of what factors might contribute and what literatures to explore in order to learn more about them. The taxonomy that I propose appears in Figure 2.4 and bifucates the possible factors thought to affect an individual’s ability to take melodic dictation into two categories: individual parameters and musical parameters. Each of these two categories can then be split again into cognitive and environmental parameters as well as structural and experimental factors respectively. Below I expand on what these categories entail, then explore each in depth. Figure 2.4: Taxonomy of Factors Contributing to Aural Skills The individual parameters split broadly into cognitive factors, or factors of people that are relatively consistent with people over time and could be understood as largely being governed by nature. The other category of this division consist of factors that change with training and exposure and could be understand as largely being governed by nurture. This second set of parameters are the environmental factors. These categories are not deterministic, nor exclusive, and almost inevitably interact with one another.7 For example, it would be possible to imagine an individual with higher cognitive ability, the oppertunity to have a high degree of training early on in their musical career, and personality traits that are associated with higher learning aptitudes. This individual’s musical perception abilities might be markedly different than someone with lower cognitive abilities, no opertunity for individualized training, come from a lower socio-economic status, and not have a general inclination to even take music lessons. This variability at the individual level might then lead to differences in their ability to take melodic dictation. Complementing the individual differences, there would also be differences at the musical level which in turn divides into two categories. On one hand exists the structural aspects of the melody itself. These are aspects of the melody that would remain invariant when written down on a score. Parameters in this category would include features generated by the interval structure of the pitches over time that allow the melody to be categorically distinct from other melodies. These structural features are then complimented by the experimental features which are emergent properties of the structrual relation of the pitches over time based on performance pratice choices. Examples of these parameters would include, key, tempo, note density, timbral qualities, and the amount of times a melody is played during a melodic dictation or emergent properties like a melody’s tonalness as computed through various metrics. This division is not an exhaustive, categorical divide. One could imagine exceptions to these rules where a melody is tranformed to the minor key, ornamented, and then played with extenive rubato and experienced as a phenomenologically similiar experience. Given all of these parameters that could contribute to the melodic dictation process, the remainder of this chapter will exploring literature using this taxonomy as a guide. The chapter conculdes with a reflection on operationalizing each of these factors and problems that can arise in modeling and reminds the reader about the dangers of statistical reification. These are important to note since from an empirical standpoint, both the task as well as the process of melodic dictation as depicted by Karpinksi resemble something that could be operationalized as both an experiment, as well as a computational model and if understood this way will be subjectd to the same types of critique. 2.2 Individual Factors 2.2.1 Cognitive Research from cognitive psychology suggests that individuals differ in their perceptual and cognitive abilities in ways that are both stable throughout a lifetime and are not easily influened by short term traning. When investigated on a large scale, these abilities– such as general intelligence or working memory capacity– predict a wealth of human behavior on a large scale ranging from longevity, annual income, ability to deal with stressful life events, and even the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (Ritchie 2015; Unsworth et al. 2005). Given the strength and generality of these predictors, it is worth investigating the extent that these abilities might contribute when investigating any modeling of melodic dictation. It is imporant to understand the degree to which these cognitive factors might influence aural skills abilities in order to ensure that the types of assesments that are given in music schools validly measure abilities that individuals have the ability to improve upon. If it is the case that much of the variance in a student’s aural skills grades can be attributed to something the student has little control over, this would call for a serious upheaval of the current model of aural skills teaching and assesment. Recently there has been a surge of interest in this area8 which could be attributed to the fact that educators are picking up on the fact that cognitive abilities are powerful predictors and need to be understood since they inevitably will play a role in pedagogical settings. Before diving into a discussion regarding differences in cognitive ability, I should note that sometimes ideas regarding differences in cognitive ability been hostily received (citation against people talking about IQ) and for good reasons. Research in this area can and has been taken advantage to further specious ideologies, but often arguments that assert meaningful differences in cognitive abilities between groups are founded on statistical misunderstandings and have been debunked in other literature (Gould 1996). Considering that, it then becomes very difficult to maintain a scientific commitment to the theory of evolution (Darwin 1859) and not expect variation in all aspects of human behavior, with cognition falling within that umbrella. Even given this statement, measuring a theoretical construct such as an aspect of cognition desereves to be examined since the ability to validly and reliably measure an individual’s cognitive ability is a fundmental assumption of this study. 2.2.2 Measuring Intelligence Attempting to measure and quantify aspects of cognition go back over a century. Even before concepts of intelligence were posited by Charles Spearman and his conception of g (Spearman 1904), scientists were interested in establishing links between an individual’s mental capacities and some sort of physical manifestation. The origins of this area of research have been critiqued on the basis that the early work implicitly tended to validate preconceptualized beliefs on the superiority of certain groups of peoples and used methodlogies that today would be considered risible. For example, BROCA thought he could get at intelligence by measuring skulls AND MORTON Or Spitzka who post hoc measured eminance and brain size page 127 While not immediatly relevant to current thinking in cognitive psychology, work from both Broca and XXX was continued by the American herediterian school of IQ (page 187 in Gould) and the early research done by Alfred Binet on IQ took inspiration from Broca. This lineage of ideas has often been used to tarnish systematic investigations into differences in cognitive ability, which from their outset were to initially funded by the French governement to identify children struggling in the classroom so that they could be given special attention. Bient was the initial developer of the idea of an intelligence quotient or IQ9 and provided one of the first ways to attempt to quantify a theoretical concept that was not capable of being manifested in the physical world. It was also around the same time that researchers like Cyril Burt and Charles Spearmean began developing their new theories of intelligence founded on the reification of factor analysis. In developing a battry of tests whose performance on one subtest could often reliabily predict performance on another– a manifestation referred to as the postive manifold– Spearman and Burt put forth a separate conception of intelligence based on the ability to solve problems without any sort of background information and referred to this ability a g for general intellgience. Though seemingly unrelated to the current state of thinking about cognitive abilities, Binet’s and Spearman’s ideologies about what intelligence is and how to measure it still represent two of the larger schools on cognitive ability. On one hand their idea that cognitive abilities are based upon a steady growth of incoming information that someone is able to manipulate once they retrieve from long term memor; on the other hand there is a school of thought that there is some sort of measureable construct, g that aids in the process of solving problems that do not depend on any sort of contextuxal information. Conceptualizing cognitive ability as these two different constructs inevitably leads to different types of measurements and subsequently what these constructs are then able to predict in terms of human behavior. Without detailing entire histories of both lines of thought, Binet’s conceptulization manifested into an argument for general crystallized intelligence or Gc, or the ability to solve problems based on previously acquired skills. Spearman and Burt’s ideas about g school reflect a belief that individuals have some sort of latent cognitive ability to draw on to perform mental tasks. The cognitive psychology literature has noted that g often shares a statistically equivalent relationship to idea conceptualized as general fluid intelligence Gf, or the ability to solve problems in novel situations Cattell, 1971; Horn, 1994). This distinction between Gf and Gc is different than that of g, but again it should be noted that Gf and g share a statistically identical relationship Matzke, Dolan, and Molenaar (2010). These conceptions of intelligenec and cognitive ability aslo differ from more current theories that sythesize these previous areas of research (Kovacs and Conway 2016). Even though both of these constructs are powerful predictors on a large scale and do predict things like educational success, income, and even life expectancy (Ritchie 2015)– even when other variables like socioeconomic status are held constant. Yet despite this, only conceptualizing cognitive abilities in terms of intelligence does not fully explain the diversity of human cognition. Another large area in the field of cognitive psychology is the area of working memory capacity. In addition to concepts of intelligence, be it Gf or Gc, the working memory capacity literature also is directly relevant to work on melodic dictation for reasons discussed below. 2.2.3 Working Memory Capacity Working memory is one of the most investigated concepts in the cognitive psychology literature. According to Nelson Cowan, the term working memory generally refers to the relatively small amount of information that one can hold in mind, attend to, or, technically speaking, maintain in a rapidly accessible state at one time. The term working is mean to indicate that mental work requires the use of such information. (p.1) (Cowan 2005) The term, like most concepts in science, does not have an exact definition, nor does it have a definitive method of measurement. While there is no universally recognized first use of the term, researchers began to postulate that there was some sort of system that mediated incoming sensory information with the world with the information in long term storage using modular models of memory in the mid-twentieth century. Summarized in (Cowan 2005), one of the first modal models of memory was proposed by (Broadbent 1958) and later expanded by (Atkinson and Shiffrin 1968). As seen in Figure 2.5, both models here posit incoming information that is then put into some sort of limited capacity store. These modal models were then expanded on by Baddeley and Hitch (Baddeley and Hitch 1974) in their 1974 chapter with the name Working Memory, where they proposed a system with an central executive module that was able to carry out active maintenance and rehearsal of information that could be stored in either a phonological store for sounds or a visual sketchpad for images. Figure 2.5: Schematics of Models of Working Memory taken from Cowan, 2005 Later revisions of their model also incorporated an episodic buffer (Baddeley 2000) where the modules were explicitly depicted as being able to interface with long term memory in the rehearsal processes. The model has even been expanded upon by other researchers throughout its lifetime. The most relevant to this study is by (Berz 1995), who postulated adding a musical rehearsal loop to the already established phonological loop and visual spatial sketchpad. While Berz is most likely correct in asserting that the nature of storing and processing musical information is different to that of words or pictures and there has been experimental evidence to suggest this (Williamson, Baddeley, and Hitch 2010) that has been interpreted in favor of multiple loops (Wöllner and Halpern 2016) , it does introduce the theoretical problem of multiple stores which has been addressed by other researchers. In addressing the problem of explicitly stating which rehearsal loops do and do not exist, Nelson Cowan proposed a separate model (Cowan 1988, 2005) dubbed the Embedded Process Model which do not claim the existence of any domain specific module (e.g. positing a phonological loop, visual spatial sketchpad) but is rather based on an exhaustive model that did away with the problem of asserting specific buffers for new types of information. In Cowan’s own words comparing his model from that of Baddeley: The aim was to see if the description of the processing structure could be exhaustive, even if not complete, in detail. By analogy, consider two descriptions of a house that has not been explored completely. Perhaps it has only been examined from the outside. Baddeley’s (1986) approach to modeling can be compared with hypothesizing that there is a kitchen, a bathroom, two equal-size square bedrooms, and a living room. This is not a bad guess, but it does not rule out the possibllity that there actually are extra bedrooms or bathroom, that the bedroom space is apportioned into two rooms very different in size, or that other rooms exist in the house. Cowan’s (1988) apporach, on the other hand, can be compared with hypothesizing that the house includes food preparating quarters, sleeping quarters, batroom/toilet quarters, and other living quarters. It is meant to be exhaustive in that nothing was left out, even though it is noncommital on the details of some of the rooms. p.42 Cowan, 2005. The system is depicted in the bottom tier of TABLE X, and conceptualizes the limited amount of information that is readily available as being in the focus of attention, with activated sensory and categorical features of what is in the focus of attention to be accessible nearby. Moving further from the locus of attention is long term memory, whose content can be turned to by using the central executive to access non-immediately available information. In contrast to the modular approaches, Cowan’s framework does not require the researchers to specify exactly how and where each the incoming information is being stored which makes it advantageous for studying complex stimuli such as music and melodies. In addition to having multiple frameworks for studying working memory capacity, there is also the problem of limits to the working memory system, often referred to as the working memory capacity. Most popularized by Miller in his famous (Miller 1956) speech turned article, Miller suggests out of jest that the number 7 might be worth investigating, which has been used as a point of reference for many researchers since then. It is worth nothing that Miller has since gone on record as noting that using 7 (plus or minus 2) was a rhetorical device used to string together his speech (Miller 1989). Nevertheless, while the number seven is most likely a red herring, it did inspire a large amount of research on capacity limits. In the decades since the number 7 has been reduced to about 4 (Cowan 2010) and research around capacity limits has been investigated using a variety of novel tasks, most noteable the complex span task CITATION. When used as predictors in both higher and lower cognitive tasks, measures of working memory capacity predict performance well and additionally tend to be stable across a lifetime (Unsworth et al. 2005). 2.2.3.1 Parallels Between Working Memory and Melodic Dictation Given its predictive strength as well as its direct similarity to tasks of melodic dictation, a in depth look at the literature is warranted. Clearly an individual’s ability to take in sensory information, maintain it in memory, actively carry out other tasks (like notating said melody) are almost identical to tasks of working memory capacity. Before venturing onward from this striking parallel, tasks investigating working memory capacity differ from melodic dictation tasks in a few key ways. The first is that musical information is always sequential: a melodic dictation task would never require the student to recall the pitches back in scrambled orders. Serial order recall is an important characteristic in the scoring and analyzing of working memory tasks (Conway et al. 2005), but musical tones do not appear in random order and are normally in discernable chunks as discussed by Karpinski(Karpinski 2000). The use of chunks is pervasive in much of the memory literature, but often is used as more of a heuristic to help explain that information in the environment and why it is often grouped together. Of the problems with chunking, most are related to music and have relevance to melodic dictation. Below I review the problems with chunking noted by Cowan (Cowan 2005), and any pertitant music psychology literature. Chunks may have a hierarchical organization. Tonal music has historically been understood to be hierarchical (Krumhansl 2001; Meyer 1956; Schenker 1935) with the study for memory for tones being confounded by some pitches being undestood by their relation to structurally more important tones. The working memory load may be reduced as working memory shifts between levels in hierarchy. If an individual understands a chunk to be something such as a major triad, the load on working memory would be less since it that information could be understood as a singular chunk. Chunks may be the endpoints of a continuum of associations. Pairing a group of tones together that might be functionally anomolous like… Chunks may include asymmetrical information. More tonal possibilities are possible from a stable note like tonic or dominant, whereas in a tonal context, a raised scale degree #\\(\\hat{4}\\) when understood in a functional context would be taken as having stricter transitional probabilities (#\\(\\hat{4} \\rightarrow \\hat{5}\\)). There may be a complex network of associations. If a set of pitches sounds like a similar set of pitches from long term memory , the information coming in can not be understood as being separate units of working memory. Chunks may increase in size rapidly over time. Three tones that are seemingly unrelated when incoming like E4, G5, C5 might enter sensory perception as three different tones, but then be fused together when they are understood as one chunk– a first inverstion major triad. Information in working memory may benefit from rapid storage in long term memory. Given the amount of patterns that an individual learns and can understand, as soon as something is fused, it could be encoded in long term memory, especially if there is a salient feature in the incoming melodic information such as the immediate recognition of a mode or cadence. The points by Cowan are important to acknowledge in that it it not possible to directly lift work and paradigms from working memory capcacity to work in music perception. That said, the enormous amount of theoretical frameworks put forward by the working memory liteature when understood in conjunction with theories in music psychology such as implicit statistical learning (Saffran et al. 1999) can provide for new, fruitul theories. Past reserachers have noted the strength and predictive abilities of literature from the working memory capacity as aiding research in music perception. In ending his article positing a musical memory loop to be annexed to the Baddley and Hitch modular model of working memory, Berz (Berz 1995) captures the power of this concept in the last sentence of his article and warns future reserachers that Individual differences portrayed in some music aptitude tests may [sic] represent not talent or musical intelligence but ability, reflecting differences in working memory capacity. p. 362 Berz’s assertion has not been exhausivly tested since first published in 1995, but the subject of music, memory, and cognitive abilities has been the focus of research of both psychologists and musicologists alike. Below I survey literature bordering on both music, as well as cognitive abiltity. 2.2.3.2 Working Memory Capacity and Music Of the papers in the music science literature that specifically investigates working memory, each uses different measures, though but all tend to converge on two general findings. The first is that there are some sort of enhanced memory capabilities in individuals with musical training. The second is that working memory capacity, however it is measured, often plays a significant role in musical tasks. Evidence for the first point appears most convincingly in a recent meta analyses by Talamini and colleagues (Talamini et al. 2017) who demonstrated via three separate meta-analyses that musicians outperform their non-musical counterparts on tasks dealing with long-term memory, short-term memory, as well as working memory. The authors also noted that the effects were the strongest in working memory tasks where the stimuli were tonal, which again suggests an advantage of exposure and understanding of the hierarchical organization of musical materials. In this meta-analyss and others investigating music and cognitive ability, it is important to be reminded that the direction of causality still from these studies cannot be determined using these statistical methodologies. While it might seem that musical training tends to lead to these increases, it is also possible that higher functioning individuals will self select into musical activities. Even if there is no seletion bias in engaging with musical activity it also remains a possiblity that of the people that do engage with musical activity, the higher functioning individuals will be less likely to quit over a lifetime. In terms of musical performance abilities, working memory capacity has also been shown to be a significant predictor. Kopiez and Lee suggested that working memory capacity should to contribute to sight reading tasks based on research where they found measures of working memory capacity, as measured by a matrix span task, to significantly correlated with many of their measures hypothesized to be related to sight reading ability in pianists at lower difficulty grading (Kopiez and Lee 2006, 2008). Following up on this work on sight reading, Meinz and Hambrick (Meinz and Hambrick 2010) found that working memory capacity, as measured by an operation span task, a reading span task, rotation span task, and a matrix span task was able to predict a small amount of variance \\(R^2=.074(0.067)\\) above and beyond that of deliberate practice alone \\(R^2=.451(.441)\\) in a sight-reading task. More recently, two studies looking at specific sub groups of musicians have shown working memory capacity to significantly contribute to models of performances on musical tasks related to novel stimuli. (Wöllner and Halpern 2016) found that although no differences were found between pianists and conductors in measures of working memory capacity as measured via a set of span tasks, conductors showed superior performance in their attention flexibility. Following up on this line of research (Nichols, Wöllner, and Halpern 2018a) used the same battery of working memory tasks and found that jazz musicians excelled over their classically trained counterparts in a task which required them to hear notes and reproduce them on the piano. The authors also noted that of their working memory battery, based on standard operation span methods (Engle 2002), that the auditory dictation condition scored surprisingly low and further research might consider further work on dictation abilities. Additionally (Colley, Keller, and Halpern 2018) found that working memory capacity, as measured by a backwards digit span and operation span, to be successful predictors in a tapping task requiring sensory motor prediction abilities. As mentioned above, each of these tasks where working memory was a significant predictor of performance occured where the task involved active enagement with novel musical material. The growing evidence in this field suggests that the advantage of working memory capacity to be greatest in both musically trained people, dealing with novel information, using tonal materials. Since all three of these factors are related to melodic dictation, it would seem sensible to continue to include these measures in tasks of musical perception and continue Berz’s assertion that research in music percetion could inadvertently be picking up on individual differences in working memory abilities. 2.2.4 General Intelligence As discussed above, the idea of IQ or intelligence has a long history that is bothgood and bad. When used as a predictor in models it often serves to predict traits that society values like longevity and general income so given its ability to predict in more domain general settings, surveying literature where it applies to musical activity is a worthy task. Below I use the term intelligence as a catch all term to avoid the historical context of IQ and specify where availible which measure was actually used. Before surveying the literature here it is also worth noting that reserach on music and intelligence is not as developed as some of the larger studies looking at intelligence which provides problems for both establishing causal directionality, as well as controlling for other factors like self theories of ability, socioeconomic status, and personality (Müllensiefen et al. 2015). 2.2.4.1 Papers that suggest GF plays a role Redo this structure As reviewed in Schellenberg (2017), both children and adults who engage in musical activity tend to score higher on general measurses of intelligence than their non-musical peers (Gibson, Folley and Park, 2009; Hille et al., 2011; Schellenberg, 2011a; Schellenberg and Mankarious, 2012) with the duration of training sharing a relationship with the extent of the increases in IQ (Degé, Kubicek and Schwarzer, 2011a; Degé, Wehrum, Stark and Schwarzer, 2015; Corrigall and Schellenberg, 2015; Corrigall, Schellenberg and Misura, 2013; Schellenberg, 2006). Though many of these studies are correlational, they also have made attempts to control for confounding variables like socio-economic status and parental involvment in out of school activities. (Corrigall et al., 2013; Degé et al., 2011a; Schellenberg, 2006, 2011a, 2011b; Schellenberg and Mankarious, 2012). Schellenberg notes the problem of smaller sample sizes in his review (Corrigall and Trainor, 2011; Parbery-Clark et al., 2011; Strait, Parbery-Clark, Hittner and Kraus, 2012) in that studies that are typically smaller do not reach statistical significance. Schellenberg also references evidence that when professional musicians are matched with non-musicians from the general population there do not seem to be these associations (CITE). Schellenberg’s review suggests the current state of the literature points to support the hypothesis that higher functioning kids that take music lessons and they tend to stay in lessons longer. Additionally, Schellenberg remains skeptical of any sorts of causal factors regarding increases in IQ (e.g., François et al., 2013; Moreno et al., 2009) noting methodlogical problems like how short exposure times were in studies claiming increases in effects or researchers who not holding pre-exisiting cognitive abilitis constant (Mehr, Schachner, Katz and Spelke, 2013). (Corrigall, Schellenberg, and Misura 2013a) (Corrigall, Schellenberg, and Misura 2013b) (Swaminathan, Schellenberg, and Khalil 2017) 2.2.5 Environmental Standing in contrast to factors that individuals do not have a much control over such as the size of their working memory capacity or factors related to their general fluid intelligence, most of the factors we believe contribute to someone’s ability to take melodic dictation have to deal with factors related to training and the environment. In fact, one of the tacit assumptions of getting a music degree revolves around the belief that with deliberate and attentive practice, that an individual is able to move from novice to expertise in their chosen domain. The idea that time invested results in beneficial returns is probably best exemplified by work produced by Ericsson, Krampe, and Tesch-Romer (1993) that suggests that performance at more elite levels results from deliberate practice. Below I review literature that supports this argument, since it’s no doubt that someone has to engage in something to be good at it. 2.2.6 Musical Training Papers that suggest practicing makes you better? It almost seems redundant to review literature in support of music practice leading to better results. List of those papers here 2.2.7 Aural Training In additon to individuals differeng in their general musical abilities– however they are defined– individuals also differ in their abilities at the level of their aural skills. Though not heavily researched in the past few decades (Furby 2016), there has been specific research looking at explaining how people do in aural skills examinatons. Harrison, Asmus, and Serpe (1994) examined the effect of aural skills training on undergraduate students by creating a latent variable model investigating musical aptitude, academic ability, musical expertise, and motivation to study music in a sample of 142 undergraduate students and claimed to be able to explain 73% of the variance in aural skills abilities using the variables measured. Work from Colin Wright’s dissertation found that … (Wright 2016) These are things that people have suggested people trying to do : As noted in Furby (2016), researchers in the past have suggested a variety of techniques for improving their abilities in melodic dictation by isolating rhythm and melody [Banton (1995); Bland (1984); Root (1931); WILSON], listening attentively to the melody before writing (Banton 1995), recognizing patterns (Banton 1995; Bland 1984; Root 1931) and silently vocalizing while dictating (Klonoski 2006). 2.2.8 Sight Singing Often described as the other side of the same coin of melodic dictation, sight singing is an area of music pedagogy research that has had sparse attention paid to it given its prevelance in school of music curricula. Recently (Fournier et al. 2017) catalouged and categorized 14 different sub categories into four larger main cateogories while also providing commenatary on some of the current state of aural skills. Of the four large categories, they group them into reading mechanisms, sight singing, readings skills acquiskiton, and learnign support. FIX HERE The authors note a line of research that has documented that university students are often unprepared to sight-read single lines of music (Asmus, 2004; Davidson, Scripp &amp; Welsh, 1988; Fournier, 2015; Thompson, 2004; Vujović &amp; Bogunović, 2012) even though it is, like dictation, thought of as a means for deeper musical understanding. (DeBellis, 2005; Karpinski, 2000; Ottman, 1956; Rogers, 2004; Scripp, 1995; Scripp &amp; Davidson, 1994) The authors of Fournier et. al also note that sight-reading has been an active area of research due to the often reported relationship that performance on sight reading often predicts several studies have shown links between academic success in sight-singing and predictors such as entrance tests (Harrison, 1987, 1990, 1991; Ottman, 1956; Rodeheaver, 1972; Schleuter, 1983), academic ability (Chadwick, 1933; Harrison, 1990, 1991; Harrison, Asmus, &amp; Serpe, 1994; Rodeheaver,1972), and musical experience (Brown, 2001; Dean, 1937; Furby, 2008; Harrison, 1990, 1991; Harrison et al., 1994; Thostenson, 1967). Taken as a whole, the research tends to suggesting that learning to be a fluid and compotent sight reader helps musicians hone their skills by bootstrapping other musical skills since the skills needed for sightreading touch on many of the skills used in musical performance like pattern matching and listening for small changes in intonnation. Each of these individual factors contributes in a small and significant way and additionally will interact with the other half of the taxonomy: musical parameters. 2.3 Musical Parameters Transitioning to the other half of the taxonomy on figure X, the other main source of variation on any study looking at melodic perception, and consequently studies of melodic dictation, is the effect of the melody itself. I find it safe to assume that not all melodies are equally difficult to dictate and assert that variance in the difficulty the melody can partitioned between both structural and experimental aspects of a melody. As noted above, there is not a strict deliniation between these two categories since once could imagine drastic maniuplations in experimental parameters in order to result in a phenomenologically different experience of melody. Questions of transformations of melodies and musical similarity fall have been addressed in ohter research (Cambouropoulos 2009; Wiggins 2007) but are beyond the scope of this study. 2.3.1 Structural The notion that the music as represented by a score is able to provide insights towards understanding aspects about music is not new to music theory and anlaysis. Heinrich Schenker argued for an undertanding of tonal music (Schenker 1935) that asserted hierarchical relationships of notes on the musical surface in the early 20th century and has since been expanded upon by theorists over the past century SALTZER, SCHAKTER, ROTHSTEIN. Leonard Meyer in his Emotion and Meaning in Music (Meyer 1956) continued some of these lines of thought and was the first who put forward the idea that tethered the struture that earlier theorists wrote about and suggested that in addition to this struture being fundamental to the perception of the piece that there were also responsible for some aspects of the emotion and meaning listeners found in the piece. Meyer’s work since inspired a line of reserach investigating the perception of the structural aspects of music could be understood with the work of Eugene Narmor (Narmour 1990, 1992), Glenn Schellenberg (Schellenberg 1997), Elizabeth Hellmuth Margulis (Margulis 2005), David Huron (Huron 2006) and have inpsired computational, machine learning approaches to expectational frameworks in with work by Marcus Pearce (M. T. Pearce and Wiggins 2012a). WHAT IS THE POINT OF ALL THIS RESERACH SETNECE These general models of melodic perception tend suggest that Meyer was correct in his assertion that computational methodologies could be used to better understand question of melodic perception and strucuture and that there are links between the structure of the music and its perception.10 Turning to studies examining melodic dictation with a focus on musical structure, the first study to examine it extensively was Ortmann in 1933 (Ortmann 1933). Ortamnn used a series of twenty five-note melodies in order to examine the effects of repetition, pitch direction, conjunct-disjunct motion (contour), interval size, order, and chord structure, all of which he deems to be the determinants of an individual’s ability to dictate melodic material. Though Ortmann did not use any statistical methods to model his data, he did assert that each of his determinants contributed to an individual’s ability to dictate musical material. This work was extended by (Taylor and Pembrook 1983) which additionally incoporated using musical skill as a predictor and additionally found evidence that these factors contributed to individual dictation abilities in a sample of 122 undergraduate students. Although the literature is generally sparce compared to other areas of music cognition, literature exploring the effects of structural characteristics on memory does exist. Long found that length, tonal structure, contour, and individual traits all contribute to performance on melodic dictation examinations and found that structure and tonalness to have significant, albeit small predictive powers in modeling (Long 1977). One problem with studies such as (Long 1977) is that they sometimes would make conspicuous methodloogical decisions such as elimnating individuals who were bad singers for the example. Not only does this reduce the spectrum of ability levels (assuming that singing ability correlates with dictation ability, a finding since which has been established (Norris 2003)), but is additinally flawed in that it is at odds both with the intuition that an individual’s singing ability cannot be taken as a direct representation of their mental image of the melody and is probably more related to the ability to have motor control over the vocal tract (Pfordresher and Brown 2007). Other researchers have also put forward other paramters thought to contribute like tempo (Hofstetter 1981) tonality (Dowling 1978) (Long 1977) (Pembrook 1986) (Oura and Hatano 1988) interval motion (Ortmann 1933; Pembrook 1986) length of melody (Long 1977; Pembrook 1986) number of presentations (Hofstetter 1981) [(Pembrook 1986)] context of presentation (Schellenberg and Moore 1985) listener experience (Long 1977; Oura and Hatano 1988) (Schellenberg and Moore 1985; Taylor and Pembrook 1983) familarity of style (Schellenberg and Moore 1985) Pembrook (1986) provides an extensive detailing of a systematic study to melodic dictation where they used tonality, melody length, and type of motion as variables in their experiment. They additionally also restricted their experimental melodies to those that were singable. The authors found all three variables to be significant predictors with tonality explaining 13% of the variance, length explaining 3% of the variance and type of motion explaining 1% of the variance. The paper also claims that people on average can hear and remember 10-16 notes, which is worth commenting that these 10–16 notes are dependent on the experimental context of the melodies played with the quarter note set to 90 beats per minute. Given the lack of consistent methodlogies in adminstration and scoring of these experiments it becomes difficult to find ways to generalize basic findings like expected effect sizes– especially when the original materials and data have not been recorded– but there is often interesting theoretical insights to be gleaned. For example (Oura 1991) used a sample of eight people to suggest that when taking melodic dictation, individuals use a system of pattern matching that interfaces with their long term memory in order to complete dictation tasks. While this paper does not bring with it exhaustive evidence supporting this claim, the idea is explored in detail in Chapter 6 the idea of pattern matching is used in conjunction with Cowan’s embeded process model of working memory. More recently the music education community has also began to do research around melodic dictation using both qualitative and quantitiatve methdologies. (Paney and Buonviri 2014) interviewed high school teachers on methods they used to teach melodic dictation and (Gillespie 2001) has done work on investigating methods as to best score melodic dictation. Other work by (Pembrook and Riggins 1990) surveyed various methodlogies used by instructurs in aural skills settings. Some of these studies consider aural skills as a totality like (Norris 2003) who provided quantiative evidence to suggest most aural skills pedagoge’s intuition that there is some sort of relationship between melodic dictation and sight singing. Looking at the notorious subset of students with absolute pitch (AP), (Dooley and Deutsch 2010) provided evidence demonstrated that students with AP tend to outperform their non-AP colleagues in tests of dication. [SOME OF THESE ARE CLEARLY EXPERIMENTAL AND NEED TO BE PUT THERE] Continuing exploring the pedagogical liteature, Naton Buonviri and colleagues have also made melodic dictation a central focus of some recent papers. Paney and Buonviri (2014) interviewed high school teachers on methods that they used to teach melodic dictation. N. Buonviri (2015) interviewed six sophomore music majors to find sucessful strategies that students enaged with when completing melodic dications. Paney (2016) reported beneficial effects to direct student’s attention and guide them through melodic dictation exercises suggesting that some sort of mental organizaton of the dication process is helpful. Nathan O Buonviri and Paney (2015) found that having students sing a preparatory singing pattern after hearing the target melody, essentially a distractor task, hindered performance on melodic dictation. Nathan O. Buonviri (2015)… N. Buonviri (2015) found no effects of test presentation format (visual versus aural-visual) using a melodic memory paradigm. Buonviri (2017) reported no significant advatage to listening strategies while partaking in a melodic dictation test. 2.3.1.1 Recent Computational Musicology Work papers and findings Using symbolic features of the melodies themselves is not a novel approach as noted in the above literature attempting to predict performance on melodic dictations. Much of this work pre-dates recent advances in computational musicology such as the advent of technology like David Huron’s Humdrum (Huron 1994) and Michael Cutberth’s Music21 (Cuthbert and Ariza 2010) which now allows music researchers to systematically digitize symbolic musical material. In addition to creating accesible frameworks for encoding, the computational power availble exponentially exceeds that of what was availble in the 20th century and has opened up new possibilities in the computational modeling of music. While I reserve a longer discussion on the histories of computational musicology for the fourth chapter, relevant to this study is the additional ways it is now possible to abstract features from symbolic melodies beyond what was capable in studies such as Ortmann (1933) and Taylor and Pembrook (1983). An abstracted feature of a melody is an emergent property of the melody that results from performing some sort of calculation on the melody? This type of feature abstraction is in contrast to much of the work done in the field of music information retrivial which often relies on the recorded audio for feature abstraction and is addressed under Experimental features LINK THAT IN!. Abstracted symbolic features of melodies can largely be conceptualized as being static or dynamic. The above papers tended to use more simplisitc methods of figuring out parameters such as counting the notes by hand but with the advent of new encoding systems and more powerful computing power it is now possible to take on much more rigerious computational analyses. 2.3.1.2 Static Views of Computational Features/ FANTASTIC Static features of melodies work by summerizing some aspect of the melody as if it were to be experience in suspended animation. Using static features helps quantify something that might be intuitive about a melody or piece of encoded music. For example, something like David Huron’s contour class used in a study investigating melodic arches (Huron 1996) using the Essen Folk Song Collection (Schaffrath 1995) can only be understood as a feature of the melody itself once the melody has been sounded and is recalled would be a static feature of a melody. Other examples include a melody’s global note density, normalized pairwise variability index (CITATION), and a melody’s tonalness as calculated by one of the various key profile algorithms (KRUMHANSL,ALBRECT AND SHANAHAN) These measures are useful when describing melodies and are predictive of various behavioral phenomena as detailed below, but at this point it has not been well established to what degree these summary features can be directly related to aspects of human behavior. The quintessential and most comprehensive toolbox example of this is Daniel Müllensiefen’s Feature ANalysis Technology Accesing STatistics (In a Corpus) or FANTASTIC (Mullensiefen 2009). FANTASTIC is software that is capable summerizing musical material at for monophonic melodies. In additon to computing 37 features such as contour variation, tonalnesss, note density, note length, and measures inspired by computational linguistics (THAT BOOK OF GERAINT), FANTASTIC also calculates m-types (melodic-rhyhmic motives) that are based on the frequency distributions of melodic segements found genres of music. This is inspired by fact that repeition is key structure of music (Huron 2006) Work using the FANTASTIC toolboox has been sucessful in predicting court case decisions (Müllensiefen and Pendzich 2009), predicting chart sucesses of songs on the Beatles’ Revolver (Kopiez and Mullensiefen 2011), memory for old and new melodies in signal detection experiments (Müllensiefen and Halpern 2014), memory for earworms (Jakubowski et al. 2017; Williamson and Müllensiefen 2012), memorability of pop music hook (Balen, Burgoyne, and Bountouridis 2015). In experimental studies, FANTASTIC has also been used to determine item difficulty (Baker and Müllensiefen 2017; Harrison, Musil, and Müllensiefen 2016) and has even been the basis of the development of a computer assistted platform for studying memory for melodies (Rainsford, Palmer, and Paine 2018). 2.3.1.3 Dynamic In addition to using summary based features on melodies, it is also possible to model the perception of musical materials by using a dynamic approach that is dependent on the unfolding of musical material. First explored in CONKLIN, and then first published as a dynamic model of expectation in his doctoral dissertation, Marcus Pearce’s Informaton Dynamics Of Melody IDyOM models musical expectancy using various information theoretic concepts inspired by Claude Shannon (SHANNON). The model takes an unsupervised machine learning approach and calculates the information content of the amount of DECLARED n-grams in the corpus. As a model exploring expection for melody IDyOM has has been applied to a variety of settings LIST THEM HERE. The domain general application of IDyOM has given creedence to Meyer’s assertion that the enculturation of musical styles stems from statistical exposure to melodies and be somewhat refelective of the cogitive processes used in muscical perception. IDyOM has also been recently extended to look at expectation in multi-part chorales (SAUVE WORK) and expectations of harmony (HARRISON WORK). (M. T. Pearce and Wiggins 2012b; ???) The advantage of using a dynamic approach is that it theoretically reflects real time perception of music with the structural characeristics of the music mapping on to real human behavior. 2.3.2 Experimental Advantage of vocal melodies paper | Weiss 2015 Voice is better than instruments Weiss Trehub Schellenberg 2012 Engaging, conspecific signal Weiss Peretz 2019 , not due to expressivity. even see this in amusics. Not affected by musical training or exposure MIR stuff Stuff out of education stuff that is also experimental WM W LVH, two span tasks and claim it effects langauge tasks WM Halpern 2017 with pearce, LTM stuff , re look this up 2.4 Modeling and Polymorphism of Ability Given the current state of cognitive psychology and psychometrics, as well as recent advances in computational musicology, the possibilities for now operationalizing and then modeling aspects of melodic dictation are as advanced as they ever have been. Given that we can now assign numbers to basically every factor that is thought to contribute to this process from concepts of musicianship, to features of a melody, to the variable size in an individual’s working memory capacity all of these thigns can be put into some sort of model. While this will bring the community closer to formally modeling all of this and lead to a clearer understanding, before going ahead and doing this it is worth pointing out that many of the concepts discussed above are highly complex concepts like musicianship and tonalness and rest on lots of assumptions. Musicianship, for example, or any measure of musical training is not something that can be measured directly such as a person’s height or weight, but has to be inferred based on the logical assumptions of the person doing the measurments. So while the rest of this study will rely on this, it is important to note that people shouldn’t confuse abstracted concepts with real things. The most illustrative example of this comes from a study by HARRISON ET AL who created a latent variable model of aural skills that was able to predict 74% of the variance in aural skills performance. This latent trait that the authors created may be helpful in explaining the patterns of covariance in data, but this would be to reifiy a statistical abstraction as an ontologically true idea. This idea has been discussed before critqiuing ideas such as g (Gould 1996; Kovacs and Conway 2016) and has recently been the subject of critique in music psychology OUR GOLDMSI PAPER. The same arguments put forward in this literature also are relevant here. In order to have a complete, causal model of how melodic dictation works, it is important to understand melodic dictation as a set of musical abilities that are related to other musical abilities, though may not be related. This idea is not new even in music psychology, the past two decades have seen calls for a more polymorphic definition of musical ability (Levitin 2012; Peretz and Coltheart 2003) which in its modeling will require more concrete ways of defining how it works than just correlating variable together that are helpful at prediction without saying exactly how that process happens. 2.5 Conclusions In this chapter I first described what is melodic dictation using Karpinki’s verbal model, noted what the things were that were missing from this model as a stepping off point, then went on to suggest a taxonomy of these based on what already has done. I suggest there are both individual as well as musical features that need to be understood in order to have a comprensive understanding of melodic dictation. Of the two sets of features, individual features can be either cognitive or environmental and musical features can be either structural or experimental. This taxonomy does not consist of exclusive categories and certainly permits interactions between any and all of the levels. It would be impossible given the scope of this study to effectively quantify each and every factor and how it interacts at every level, but the degree to which there is the most literature and you can get the most bang for you buck seems like the obvious stepping off point. Rest of this dissertation will systehsize these areas and put forth novel research contributing to the modeling and subsequent understanding of melodic dictation. Understanding melodic dictation will help with both understanding melodic perception and help our pedagogy. 2.5.1 Add In (Hansen, Wallentin, and Vuust 2013) Dowling 1991 (Dowling 1991) References "],
["individual-differences.html", "Chapter 3 Individual Differences 3.1 Rationale 3.2 Individual Differences 3.3 Overview of Experiment 3.4 Discussion", " Chapter 3 Individual Differences 3.1 Rationale The first two steps of Gary Karpinski’s model of melodic dictation (Karpinski 2000, 1990) rely exclusively on the mental representation of melodic information. Karpinski conceptualizes the first stage of hearing as involving the physical motions on the tympanic membrane, as well as the listener’s attention to the musical stimulus. This stage is distinguished from that of short-term melodic memory which refers to the amount of melodic information that can be represented in conscious awareness. Given that neither stage of the first two steps of Karpinski’s model requires any sort of musical expertise, every individual with normal hearing and cognition should be able to partake in the first two steps of melodic dictation.11 The ability to hear, then remember musical information is where all students of melodic dictation are presumed to begin their aural skills education. From this baseline, students receive explicit education in music theory and aural skills to develop the ability to link they hear to what can then be musically understood and consequently notated. While the majority of beginning students of melodic dictation are assumed to start at the same ability, cognitive psychology research suggests that individual differences in cognitive ability exist and must be accounted for from a psychological and pedagogical perspective (Cowan 2005; Ritchie 2015)12. In order to fully capture the diversity of listening abilities among students of melodic dictation, a complete account of melodic dictation must include individual differences in ability. Understanding how differences at the individual level vary also will help pedagogues know what can be reasonably expected of students with different experiences and abilities. Attempting to investigate all four parts of melodic dictation from hearing, to short-term melodic memory, to musical understanding, to notation is cumbersome both from a theoretical perspective and practically unfeasible due to the amount of variables that contribute to this process. In order to obtain a clearer picture of what mechanisms contribute to this process, these steps must be be investigated in turn. This chapter investigates the first two steps of the Karpinski model of melodic dictation (Karpinski 2000, 1990) with an experiment examining individual factors that contribute to musical memory that do not depend on knowledge of Western musical notation. By understanding which, if any, individual factors play a role in this process, it will inform what can be reasonably expected of individuals when other musical variables are then introduced. 3.2 Individual Differences 3.2.1 Improving Musical Memory Most aural skills pedagogy assumes students begin with approximately the same baseline listening and dictation abilities. Assuming this baseline allows teachers to cover requisite information systematically and ensure that students are given the the same tools to enable their success in the classroom. This assumption of similar baseline of abilities is implicit in the Karpinski model of melodic dictation. The model provides a framework of mental choreography students are encouraged to build upon that is agnostic to individual differences; Karpinski’s model assumes that all individuals regardless of their background will engage in the same process. As students gain more knowledge in music theory, they build their musical understanding which in turn enables them to recognize more of the auditory scene they are focusing on. In addition to learning explicit knowledge to facilitate their musical understanding, Karpinski suggests that there are two other skills that students can develop in order to improve their short-term musical memory: extractive listening and chunking. In Karpinski’s own words:“Only one or both strategies can extend the capacity of short-term musical memory: (1) extractive listening and (2) chunking. (pp. 71)” Karpinski defines extractive listening as “a combination of focused attention and selective memorization (p.70)”. Extractive listening requires students to be able to focus on the material they will be mentally representing and tune out other sources of stimulation that might distract the student. In order to improve this ability, Karpinski suggests practicing listening to melodies and having students practice directing their attention to pre-determined set sequences of notes. Students should slowly work towards being able to auralize the melody with other musical information still sounding. Karpinski claims that honing one’s attention via this type of progressive practice will not only improve student’s ability to dictate melodies, but also help them with a host of other musical activity. Further, Timothy Chenette has since proposed similar types of progressive loading aural exercises by co-opting standard cognitive tasks used in working memory paradigms (Chenette 2019) in order to help students improve their ability to focus in aural skills. After students master the ability to selectively hear and retain portion of a melody, the other way in which they can improve their dictation abilities is via chunking. Chunking is a listener’s ability group smaller units of musical material into a larger group. The idea of chunking derives from earlier work from Gestalt psychologists and was one of the initial mechanisms proposed by Miller (1956) able to extend the finite window of memory. The general idea is that if a collection of notes can be identified as its own discrete entity– such as a descending major triad in first inversion– the listener will only have to remember that one structure, rather than its component parts. As discussed in the previous chapter in Parallels Between Working Memory and Melodic Dictation, music’s inherently sequential nature affords it many opportunities to find repeated patterns which can be labeled, musically understood, and thus chunked. While stimuli that are inherently sequential are problematic for psychologists investigating capacity limits of working memory capacity (Cowan 2005), students are expected to use chunking to their advantage in order to become more adept listeners. As students learn to chunk more efficiently, they are able to process more musical information in their short-term musical memory. With the development of both skills, students are presumed to increase their musical memory and ultimately improve their melodic dictation abilities. But what evidence supports the assertion that individuals are able to improve on their ability to both learn and remember melodies? 3.2.2 Memory for Melodies Research findings from the memory for melody literature are mixed when considering how people vary in their ability to remember musical material (Halpern and Bartlett 2010). For example, no effect of an individual’s musical training was found by McAuley, Stevens, and Humphreys (2004) in a paradigm where both musically trained and non-musically trained individuals were presented with melodies using a recognition paradigm task with melodies over the course of two days. In a musical recognition task, Korenman and Peynircioğlu (2004) found no effect of musicianship on memory. Using a recognition paradigm, Mungan, Peynirvioglu, and Halpern (2011) found an effect of musical training on melodic memory, but the significant effect reported was not found in correctly identifying melodies, but rather in correctly identifying melodies that they had not heard before. Müllensiefen and Halpern (2014) reported no effects of musical training on their recognition paradigm experiment. They however did not include any expert participants in their sample and the focus of this particular study was to look at structural features of the melody, rather than individual level features. Additionally, other studies have also found that musical expertise is not a successful predictor of melodic recognition (Demorest et al. 2008; Halpern, Bartlett, and Dowling 1995). As with much of the music psychology literature, one of the reasons that these studies may have not found a memory advantage for the more musically trained is that how musical training is measured varies widely from study to study (Talamini et al. 2017). This inability to measure musical exposure additionally complicates controlling for the amount of variability of what might drive the memory effects in the models of musical memory. When measured continuously using paradigms that require immediate recall and judgment, musical training does often predict memory for musical materials. Using a step wise modeling procedure, Harrison, Musil, and Müllensiefen (2016) consistently found evidence that musical training to be a significant predictor of ability to preform well on a melodic discrimination task when developing an item response theory based test of melodic memory. Using regression modeling, Harrison et. al reported to be able to explain a large amount of the variance (\\(R^2 = 0.459\\)) when reporting response variability in a melodic discrimination task (Harrison, Collins, and Müllensiefen 2017) when measuring musical training via the Goldsmith’s Musical Sophistication Index (Müllensiefen et al. 2014). Baker and Müllensiefen (2017) found musical training, when measured continuously, was able to be a significant predictor using a exposure-recall paradigm among other predictor variables. Even despite mixed evidence suggesting different effects of musical training on an individual’s ability to remember melodies, it is important to note that these studies do not specifically deal with melodic dictation, and thus cannot be used as a perfect comparison for a number of reasons. The first is that melodic dictation is a much more complicated process that not only involves hearing a melody after a few iterations, but also its notation. Seeing as students need to notate their melodies, which again is dependent on their knowledge of Western musical notation, melodic dictation is secondly a more cognitively demanding process than the previously mentioned studies on memory for melody which often only require a simple discrimination. 3.2.3 Musician’s Cognitive Advantage While the above memory for melodies literature is mixed regarding the musician’s advantage, there is research from cognitive psychology to support the latter evidence of an advantage of musical training in perceptual tests. Some researchers suggest that musicians have better cognitive abilities on a more domain general level, which could lead to better performance and explain differences in performance. Work as reviewed in Schellenberg (2017) investigating the relationship between musical training and general intelligence suggest that both children and adults who engage in musical activity tend to score higher on general measures of intelligence than their non-musical peers (Gibson, Folley, and Park 2009; Hille et al. 2011; Schellenberg 2011; Schellenberg and Mankarious 2012). Importantly, this association between intelligence and musical training comes with a correlation between duration of musical training and the extent of the increases in intelligence (Corrigall, Schellenberg, and Misura 2013a; Corrigall and Schellenberg 2015; Degé, Kubicek, and Schwarzer 2011; Schellenberg 2006). While many of these studies are correlation, other researchers have further investigated this relationship in experimental settings in attempt to control for confounding variables like socio-economic status and parental involvement in out of school activities (Corrigall, Schellenberg, and Misura 2013c; Degé, Kubicek, and Schwarzer 2011; Schellenberg 2011, 2006; Schellenberg and Mankarious 2012), but findings have been mixed. Schellenberg (Schellenberg 2017) notes that in many of these studies there is a problem of too small of a sample size in his review (Corrigall and Trainor 2011; Parbery-Clark et al. 2011; Strait et al. 2012) in that studies that are typically smaller might be under powered to detect any effects. Also referenced in Schellenberg’s review is evidence that when professional musicians are matched with non-musicians from the general population these associations are non-existent (Schellenberg 2015). Interpreting the current literature Schellenberg puts forward the hypothesis that higher functioning children might self-select into music lessons and they tend to stay in lessons longer which leads to the observed differences in intelligence. Additionally, Schellenberg remains skeptical of any sorts of causal factors regarding increases in IQ (Francois et al. 2013; Moreno et al. 2009) noting methodological problems such as short exposure times or researchers who did not holding pre-existing cognitive abilities constant (Mehr et al. 2013). In addition to general intelligence, another cognitive ability where musicians tend to exhibit superior performance is that of memory. Talamini et al. (2017)’s meta-analysis investigating musical training and memory found not only a general advantage of musicians, but noted that musicians tended to perform better on memory tasks especially in cases where stimuli were short and tonal. This musician advantage could derive from a musician’s ability to chunk information more effectively based on past exposure via implicit learning practices (Ettlinger, Margulis, and Wong 2011; Rohrmeier and Rebuschat 2012). This difference also might reflect the above mentioned self-selection of higher functioning individuals to partake in music, which then explain the differences in memory. As noted above, much of the research at this point still very much focuses on higher level relationships, which is progressively being improved upon by agreeing on how to measure what is actually driving these effects. Until more concrete theories emerge that link specific musical traits to music ability, music psychology will not be able to put forward clearer models of causal effects (Baker et al. 2018). 3.2.4 Relationship Established Regardless of the direction of causality, the evidence discussed suggests that there is a relationship between musical training and cognitive ability. Clearly cognitive ability is at play in many tasks of perception and production and presumably these abilities would interact with other variables of interest such as musical training as theorized by some researchers above. Even in studies outside of music, domain general cognitive abilities have been shown to be predictive above and beyond domain specific expertise. In reviewing the current literature, (Hambrick, Burgoyne, and Oswald 2019) reiterate that while there is evidence some of the time in many domain specific areas like chess, games, and music, the current state of the literature is not definitive enough to explain exactly how this phenomena works on a global level. Though of all the studies mentioned thus far, one cognitive ability deserving of special attention is that of working memory. As noted by (Berz 1995), many tests of memory– such as the tests above–require the encoding and active manipulation of musical material. In his 1995 article, Berz draws important parallels between working memory systems and music tests and postulated new loop. For example Meinz and Hambrick (2010) found working memory to be predictive of performance in a sight reading task above and beyond that of deliberate practice. Work by Kopiez (Kopiez and Lee 2006, 2008) has additionally linked the importance of working memory to performance on sight reading tasks. In multiple studies, Andrea Halpern and colleagues have also shown measures of working memory to be linked to performance in musical production tasks (Halpern and Müllensiefen 2008; Nichols, Wöllner, and Halpern 2018b) and has even interpreted these findings in terms of Berz’s memory loop. Other work by Harrison, Musil, and Müllensiefen (2016) has also made important links to an individual’s ability to remember and recall musical information and working memory. Harrison and colleagues put forward a cognitive model based on research in working memory that predicted which features of a melody– based on theoretical considerations from working memory– would be best at predicting behavioral performance. They proposed that perceptual encoding, memory retention, similarity comparison, and decision-making could be used to contextualize differences in their memory recognition paradigm. While they did find evidence to support these notions, they did not take any domain general measures of working memory capacity and thus were unable to conclude if domain general processes were able to better explain their data than using individual level predictors. Additionally, Okada and Slevc (2018) used a latent variable approach where they investigated executive function in a sample of 161 university students. Using Miyake’s conception of executive function (Miyake and Friedman 2012; Miyake et al. 2000) and mixed effects modeling, Okada and Slevc found an effect of musical training as measures withe Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index on the updating component of the executive functioning model, a construct often interpreted as similar to working memory capacity. Okada and Slevc did not however link performance on their executive functioning tasks to an objective measure of musical performance implemented by the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index. 3.2.5 Dictation Without Dictation So given the complex network of variables at play, in order to understand how these individual factors affect the first two steps of melodic dictation, a multivariate approach is needed. In order to investigate the effects of individual factors on baseline, I must first assume that using a melodic discrimination paradigm can be used as a proxy for the first two steps of the Karpinski model of melodic dictation. I argue that because melodic discrimination paradigms require perceptual encoding, memory retention, and two other cognitive manipulations of similarity comparison and decision making as argued by Harrison, Musil, and Müllensiefen (2016), this paradigms do in fact resemble the first two steps of the Karpinski model. Karpinski’s hearing and short-term musical memory could just as easily be described as perceptual encoding and memory retention. Additionally, the requirement to execute a decision while representing musical information in memory– Harrison and colleague’s Similarity Comparison and Descion making– can be mapped on to later stages of Karpinski’s model of musical understanding, and subsequently notation. One of the most complete suites of measuring musicality that employs both objective and subjective measures of musical sophistication is the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index or Gold-MSI (Müllensiefen et al. 2014). The Gold-MSI has both a self-report questionnaire as well as two test of objective ability. One of the tests employs a beat detection paradigm, the other is a melodic discrimination paradigm. Seeing as both measures mirror tasks used in the aural skills classroom and the two are purported to measure different constructs, both will be used in this study. Since its initial publication, adaptive short forms of the tests have been developed using item response theory (Harrison, Collins, and Müllensiefen 2017). These tests were not available to be used at the time of this study’s data collection. Assuming that a melodic discrimination task can then stand in for the first two steps of the Karpinski model, I can then model the relationships between performance on this musical memory task with individual level variables using structural equation modeling. By doing this I can examine the extent to which, if any, factors contribute to the first two steps of melodic dictation. 3.2.6 Cognitive Measures of Interest Having previously established that many tests of musical ability and aptitude may in fact be tests of working memory (Berz 1995), one factor not yet accounted for in the memory for melodies literature is a domain general measure of working memory. If working memory is conceptualized using Cowan’s model of working memory as the window of attention (Cowan 2010), measuring working memory would need to be operationalized using a task that implements both the retention and manipulation of information in memory. This is commonly done with complex span tasks (Unsworth et al. 2005). Complex span tasks, unlike simple span tasks like the n-back paradigms, require both the retention and manipulation of items in memory and thus better reflect a Cowanian model of working memory (Cowan 2005). Additionally, since general intelligence is often predictive of performance on a host of cognitive tasks such as educational success, income, and even life expectancy (Ritchie 2015) and has been theoretically related to working memory (Kovacs and Conway 2016), this measure should also be accounted for when investigating individual features that contribute to the first two steps of melodic dictation using a standard paradigms of intelligence testing (Raven 1994; Thurstone 1938). Finally, in response to claims made by Okada and Slevc (2018), having to need to account for specific covariates, this study also will track socioeconomic status and degree of education, variables used in previous music psychology research (Corrigall, Schellenberg, and Misura 2013a; Swaminathan, Schellenberg, and Khalil 2017). 3.2.7 Structural Equation Modeling Given the complex nature being investigated and the theoretical concepts at play such as working memory, general fluid intelligence, and musical sophistication conceptualized as a latent variable, it follows that the most appropriate method of parsing out the variance in this covariance structure would be to use some form of structural equation modeling (Beaujean 2014). Structural equation modeling uses latent variables, theoretical constructs thought to exist yet are not possible to measure directly, that using a closed set of algebraic systems originally developed by Sewall Wright (Wright 1934). When used under the right conditions, the technique is powerful enough to determine casual mechanisms in closed systems (Pearl and Mackenzie 2018), but this is not the case in this analysis. 3.2.8 Hypotheses If I then assume that a same-different melodic memory paradigm is a stable proxy for the first two steps of Karpinski’s model of melodic dictation, then data generated from both objective tests of the Goldsmiths’ Musical Sophistication Index can serve as proxy for this measure of interest. In this analyses, I will use a series of structural equation models in order to investigate how various individual factors contribute to an individual’s memory for melody. Following a step-wise procedure, these sets of analyses will provide a way to investigate what individual factors need to be accounted for in future research. Given a robust instrument for measuring musicality, and two well established cognitive measures as specifically defined below, this analysis seeks to investigate the degree to which these individual level variables are predictive of a task that is proxy to the first two steps of melodic dictation. If a large proportion of the variance of musical memory can be attributed to training, then variables related to the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index should be most predictive with the highest path coefficients and lead to the best model fit. If instead cognitive factors do play a role, this should be evident in the path loadings. 3.3 Overview of Experiment 3.3.1 Participants Two hundred fifty-four students enrolled at Louisiana State University completed the study. Students were mainly recruited in the Department of Psychology and the School of Music. The criteria for inclusion in the analysis were no self-reported hearing loss, not actively taking medication that would alter cognitive performance, and the removal of any univariate outliers (defined as individuals whose performance on any task was greater than 3 standard deviations from the mean score of that task). Using these criteria, eight participants were not eligible due to self reporting hearing loss, one participant was removed for age, and six participants were eliminated as univariate outliers due to performance on one or more of the tasks of working memory capacity. Thus, 239 participants met the criteria for inclusion. The eligible participants were between the ages of 17 and 43 (M = 19.72, SD = 2.74; 148 females). Participants volunteered, received course credit, or were paid $20. 3.3.2 Materials 3.3.2.1 Cognitive Measures All variables used for modeling approximated normal distributions. Processing errors for each task were positively skewed for the complex span tasks similar to Unsworth et al. (2009). Positive and significant correlations were found between recall scores on the three tasks measuring working memory capacity (WMC) and the two measuring general fluid intelligence (Gf). The WMC recall scores negatively correlated with the reported number of errors in each task, suggesting that rehearsal processes were effectively limited by the processing tasks (Unsworth et al. 2009). 3.3.2.2 Measures 3.3.2.2.1 Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index Self Report (Gold-MSI) Participants completed a 38-item self-report inventory and questions consisted of free response answers or choosing a selection on a likert scale that ranged from 1-7. (Müllensiefen et al. 2014). The complete survey with all questions used can be found at goo.gl/dqtSaB. 3.3.2.2.2 Tone Span (TSPAN) Participants completed a two-step math operation and then tried to remember three different tones in an alternating sequence (based upon Unsworth et al. (2005)). We modeled the three tones after Li, Cowan, and Saults (2013) paper’s using frequencies outside of the equal tempered system (200Hz, 375Hz, 702Hz). The same math operation procedure as OSPAN was used. The tones was presented aurally for 1000ms after each math operation. During tone recall, participants were presented three different options H M and L (High, Medium, and Low), each with its own check box. Tones were recalled in serial order by clicking on each tone’s box in the appropriate order. Tone recall was untimed. Participants were provided practice trials and similar to OSPAN, the test procedure included three trials of each list length (3-7 tones), totaling 75 letters and 75 math operations. 3.3.2.2.3 Operation Span (OSPAN) Participants completed a two-step math operation and then tried to remember a letter (F, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, R, S, T, or Y) in an alternating sequence (Unsworth et al. 2005). The same math operation procedure as TSPAN was used. The letter was presented visually for 1000ms after each math operation. During letter recall, participants saw a 4 x 3 matrix of all possible letters, each with its own check box. Letters were recalled in serial order by clicking on each letter’s box in the appropriate order. Letter recall was untimed. Participants were provided practice trials and similar to TSPAN, the test procedure included three trials of each list length (3-7 letters), totalling 75 letters and 75 math operations. 3.3.2.2.4 Symmetry Span (SSPAN) Participants completed a two-step symmetry judgment and were prompted to recall a visually-presented red square on a 4 X 4 matrix (Unsworth et al. 2005). In the symmetry judgment, participants were shown an 8 x 8 matrix with random squares filled in blank. Participants had to decide if the black squares were symmetrical about the matrix’s vertical axis and then click the screen. Next, they were shown a “yes” and “no” box and clicked on the appropriate box. Participants then saw a 4 X 4 matrix for 650 ms with one red square after each symmetry judgment. During square recall, participants recalled the location of each red square by clicking on the appropriate cell in serial order. Participants were provided practice trials to become familiar with the procedure. The test procedure included three trials of each list length (2-5 red squares), totalling 42 squares and 42 symmetry judgments. 3.3.2.2.5 Gold-MSI Beat Perception Participants were presented 18 excerpts of instrumental music from rock, jazz, and classical genres (Müllensiefen et al. 2014). Each excerpt was presented for 10 to 16s through headphones and had a tempo ranging from 86 to 165 beats per minute. A metronome beep was played over each excerpt either on or off the beat. Half of the excerpts had a beep on the beat, and the other half had a beep off the beat. After each excerpt was played, participants answered if the metronome beep was on or off the beat and provided their confidence: “I am sure”, “I am somewhat sure”, or “I am guessing”. The final score was the proportion of correct responses on the beat judgment. 3.3.2.2.6 Gold-MSI Melodic Memory Test Participants were presented melodies between 10 to 17 notes long through headphones (Müllensiefen et al. 2014). There were 12 trials, half with the same melody and half with different melodies. During each trial, two versions of a melody were presented. The second version was transposed to a different key. In half of the second version melodies, a note was changed a step up or down from its original position in the structure of the melody. After each trial, participants answered if the two melodies had identical pitch interval structures. 3.3.2.2.7 Number Series Participants were presented with a series of numbers with an underlying pattern. After being given two example problems to solve, participants had 4.5 minutes in order to solve 15 different problems. Each trial had 5 different options as possible answers (Thurstone 1938). 3.3.2.2.8 Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices Participants were presented a 3 x 3 matrix of geometric patterns with one pattern missing (Raven 1994). Up to eight pattern choices were given at the bottom of the screen. Participants had to click the choice that correctly fit the pattern above. There were three blocks of 12 problems, totalling 36 problems. The items increased in difficulty across each block. A maximum of 5 min was allotted for each block, totalling 15 min. The final score was the total number of correct responses across the three blocks. 3.3.3 Procedure Participants in this experiment completed eight different tasks, lasting about 90 minutes in duration. The tasks consisted of the Gold-MSI self-report inventory, coupled with the Short Test of Musical Preferences, and a supplementary demographic questionnaire that included questions about socioeconomic status, aural skills history, hearing loss, and any medication that might affect their ability to perform on cognitive tests. Following the survey they completed three WMC tasks: a novel Tonal Span, Symmetry span, and Operation span task; a battery of perceptual tests from the Gold-MSI (Melodic Memory, Beat Perception, Sound Similarity) and two tests of general fluid intelligence (Gf): Number Series and Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices. Each task was administered in the order listed above on a desktop computer. Sounds were presented at a comfortable listening level for the tasks that required headphones. All participants provided informed consent and were debriefed. Only measures used in modeling are reported below. 3.3.4 Results 3.3.4.1 Descriptive, Data Screening, Correlational The goal of the analyses was to examine the relationships among the measures and constructs of WMC, general fluid intelligence, musical sophistication (operationalized as the General score from the Gold-MSI), in relation to the two objective listening tests on the Gold-MSI. Before running any sort of modeling, we inspected our data to ensure in addition to outlier issues as mentioned above, the data exhibited normal distributions. I report both correlation values, as well as visually displaying our distributions in Figure 1. Before running any modeling, I checked our data for assumptions of normality since violations of normality can strongly affect the covariances between items. While some items in Figure 1 displayed a negative skew, many of the individual level items from the self report scale exhibited high levels of Skew and Kurtosis beyond the generally accepted ± 2 (Field, Miles, and Field 2012), but none of the items with the unsatisfactory measures are used in the general factor. 3.3.4.2 Modeling 3.3.4.2.1 Measurement Model I then fit a measurement model to examine the underlying structure of the variables of interest used to assess the latent constructs (general musical sophistication, WMC, general fluid intelligence) by performing a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using the lavaan package (Rosseel 2012) using R (Team 2015). Model fits in can be found in Table X. For each model, latent factors were constrained to have a mean of 0 and variance of 1 in order to allow the latent covariances to be interpreted as correlations. Since the objective measures were on different scales, all variables were converted to z scores before running any modeling. Figure 3.1: CFA Measurement Model Variables are listed in the table below: Abbreviation Variable gen General Self-Report Musical Sophistication wmc Working Memory Capacity gf General Fluid Intelligence zIS Identify What is Special zHO Hear Once Sing Back zSB Sing Back After 2-3 zDS Don’t Sing In Public zSH Sing In Harmony zJI Join In zNI Number of Instruments zRP Regular Practice zNCS Not Consider Self Musician zNcV Never Complimented zST Self Tonal zCP Compare Performances zAd Addiction zSI Search Internet zWr Writing About Music zFr Free Time zTP Tone Span zMS Symmetry Span zMO Operation Span zRA Ravens zAN Number Series 3.3.4.3 Structural Equation Models Following the initial measurement model, I then fit a series of structural equation models in order to investigate both the degree to which factor loadings changed when variables were removed from the model as well as the model fits. I began with a model incorporating our three latent variables (general musical sophistication, WMC, general fluid intelligence) predicting our two objective measures (beat perception and melodic memory scores) and then detailed steps we took in order to improve model fit. For each model, I calculated four model fits: \\(\\chi^2\\) , comparative fit index (CFI), root mean square error (RMSEA), and Tucker Lewis Index (TLI). In general, a non-significant \\(\\chi^2\\) indicates good model fit, but is overly sensitive to sample size. Comparative Fit Index (CFI) values of .95 or higher are considered to be indicative of good model fits as well as Root Mean Square Error (RMSEA) values of .06 or lower, Tucker Lewis Index (TLI) values closer to 1 indicate a better fit (Beaujean 2014). After running the first model (Model 1), I then examined the residuals between the correlation matrix the model expects and our actual correlation matrix looking for residuals above .1. While some variables scored near .1, two items dealing with being able to sing (“I can hear a melody once and sing it back after hearing it 2 – 3 times” and “I can hear a melody once and sing it back”) exhibited a high level of correlation amongst the residuals (.41) and were removed for Model 2 and model fit improved significantly (\\(\\chi^2\\) (41)=123.39, p &lt; . 001). After removing the poorly fitting items, I then proceeded to examine if removing the general musical sophistication self-report measures would significantly improve model fit for Model 3. Fit measures for Model 3 can be seen in Table 3 and removing the self-report items resulted in a significantly better model fit (χ2 (171)=438.8, p &lt; . 001). Following the rule of thumb that at least 3 variables should be used to define any latent-variable (Beaujean 2014) I modeled WMC as latent variable and Gf as a composite average of the two tasks administered in order to improve model fit. This model resulted in significant improvement to the model (\\(\\chi^2\\) (4)=14.37, p &lt; . 001). Finally I examined the change in test statistics between Model 2 and a model that removed the cognitive measures– a model akin to one of the original models reported in (Müllensiefen et al. 2014)– for Model 5. Testing between the two models resulted in a significant improvement in model fit (\\(\\chi^2\\) (78)=104.75, p &lt; . 001). Figure X displays Model 4, our nested model with the best fit indices.

This finding is to be expected since no clear theoretical model has been put forward that would suggest that the general musical sophistication score, when modeled with two cognitive measures should have a “good” model fit. This model was run to create a baseline measurement. 3.4.1.2 Structural Equation Model Fitting Following a series of nested model fits, we were able to improve model fits on a series of structural equation models that incorporated both measures of working memory capacity and measures of general fluid intelligence. Before commenting on new models, it is worth noting that the Model 5 does not seem to align with the findings from the original 2014 paper by (Müllensiefen et al. 2014). While the correlation between the objective tasks is the same (r = .16), the factor loadings from this paper suggest lower values for both Beat Perception (.37 original, .27 this paper) as well as Melodic Memory (.28 original, .18 this paper). Note that two items were removed dealing with melody for memory for this model; when those items were re-run with the data, the factor loadings did not deviate from these numbers. The first two models I ran resulted in minor improvements to model fit. While difference in models was significant (\\(\\chi^2\\) (41)=123.39, p &lt; . 001), probably due to the number of parameters that were now not constrained, the relative fit indices of the models did not change drastically. It was not until the self-report measures were removed from the model, and then manipulated according to latent variable modeling recommendations, was there a marked increase in the relative fit indices. Fitting the model with only the cognitive measures, I was able to enter the bounds of acceptable relative fit indices that were noted above. In order to finding evidence that the cognitive models (Models 3 and 4) were indeed a better fit than using the General factor, I additionally ran a comparison between our adjusted measurement model and a model with only the self-report. While both of the nested models were significantly different, the cognitive models exhibited superior relative fit indices. Lastly, turning to Figure 3, I note that the latent variable of working memory capacity exhibited much larger factor loadings predicting the two objective, perceptual tests than our measure of general fluid intelligence. I also note that the factor loading predicting the Beat Perception task (.36) was higher than that of the Melodic Memory task (.21). These rankings mirror that of the original (Müllensiefen et al. 2014) paper and merit further examination in order to disentangle what processes are contributing to both tasks. Given the results here that suggest that measures of cognitive ability play a significant role in tasks of musical perception, we suggest that future research should consider taking measures of cognitive ability into account, so that other variables of interest are able to be shown to contribute above and beyond baseline cognitive measures. 3.4.2 Relating to Melodic Dictation This study sought to investigate the extent to which individual factors contributed to an individual’s ability to perform the first two steps of melodic dictation. In order to do this, I assumed that the first two steps of the Karpinski model– hearing and short term melodic memory– could be investigated by using a same-different melodic memory paradigm. Both task require the dual activation of representing information in conscious awareness and completing a cognitive task. Using this paradigm also allowed me to investigate the first to steps of Karpinski’s model using both individuals with and without musical training. Overall, when interpreting the results I found evidence to corroborate claims made by Berz (1995) positing the importance of working memory in both tests of musical aptitude, and consequently the first two steps of melodic dictation as described by Karpinski. Relatively, working memory seemed to dominate as the variable with the most explanatory power as derived from both the best overall model fits and highest path coefficients in the latent variable modeling. This is not a surprising finding given the context, yet has major implications for future research in music perception. If a domain general process is able to predict performance on a domain specific task (melodic memory) better than measures of self report and training, future studies in music perception will need to be able to demonstrate how the process they purport to be the driving factor behind their models explains their findings above and beyond working memory capacity. Also worth discussing is why general fluid intelligence did not fare as well in the models above. One reason that this might be is because general intelligence tests are designed in two ways differing from that of melodic dictation. The first is that general fluid intelligence tests administered here do not have any time component to them. While tasks like Raven’s matrices (Raven 1994) and the number series (Thurstone 1938) tests are timed, the information is presented visually to participants. The second is that general fluid intelligence is designed to measure abilities outside of the context of previously known information (Cattell 1971) and questions surrounding music perception depend both principles of statistical learning (Huron 2006; Pearce 2018; Saffran et al. 1999) and stylistic enculturation (Demorest et al. 2008; Eerola, Louhivuori, and Lebaka 2009; Meyer 1956). General fluid intelligence might be helpful at later stages of cognitive processing such as the musical understanding and notation phases of the Karpinski model, but their effect does not seem to be present here. From a pedagogical standpoint, this is important in that many teachers are aware that students will vary in terms of their working memory ability. While it would be statistically rare to actually find someone with a working memory deficit, knowing that this construct is powerful predictor of performance at such an early stage of melodic dictation reinforces that teachers should be aware of it. One practical consideration for the classroom within the Karpinksi framework would be to encourage students to listen for smaller chunks when using extractive listening. Using a Cowanian model of working memory, students should extract smaller chunks so that they still have cognitive resources available in order to focus on the later stages of the Karpinski model (musical understanding and notation). As attention is limited, not listening to more than you can hold will free up cognitive resources that might later be used in melodic dictation. Further students could take up recommendations like that of Chenette (2019) and focus on activities that might help them increase their ability to focus, knowing that this practice will most likely not increase their working memory. Not only will this finding have relevance in the classroom, but this findings suggests that future work looking to do more robust modeling of melodic dictation must take into account the window of attention. In chapter X, I incorporate this finding into a computational model of melodic dictation and use the finite window of working memory as a perceptual bottleneck to constrain incoming musical information. In this chapter I fit a series of structural equation models in order to investigate the degree to which baseline cognitive ability was able to predict performance on a musical perception task. My findings suggest that measures of working memory capacity are able to account for a large amount of variance beyond that of self report in tasks of musical perception. References "],

Teaching aural skills typically starts with providing students with simpler exercises, often employing a limited number of notes and rhythms, and then slowly progressing to more difficult repertoire. This progression from simpler to more difficult exercises is evident in aural skills text books. Of the major aural skills textbooks such as the Ottman and Rogers (2014), Berkowitz (2011), Karpinski (2007), and Cleland and Dobrea-Grindahl (2010), each is structured in a way that musical material presented earlier on in the book is more manageable than that nearer the end. In fact, this is true of almost any étude book: open to a random page in a book of musical studies and the difficulty of the study will likely scale accordingly to its relative position in the textbook. But it is not a melody’s position in a textbook that makes it difficult to perform: this difficulty comes from the structural elements from the music itself. Theorists intution for complexity can map to features Intuitively, music theorists have a general understanding of what makes a melody difficult to dictate.13 Factors that might contribute to this complexity could range from the melody’s note density, the intricacies of the rhythms involved, the scale from which the melody derives, or even more intuitively understood factors such as how tonal the melody sounds. Although given all these factors, there is no definitive combination of features that perfectly predicts the degree to which theorists will agree how complex a melody is. In many ways, questions of melodic complexity are very much like questions of melodic similarity: it depends on both who is asking the question and for what reasons (Cambouropoulos 2009). Look, an example Looking at the melodies presented in Figures X and Y, most aural skills pedagogues will be able to successfully intuit which melody is more complex, and presumably, more difficulty to dictate. FIGURE 1 – Melody with 8 Bars, functional accidentals (V/V, V/IV) FIGURE 2 – Same sets of notes rearranged While I reserve an extended discussion of what features might characterize why one melody is more difficult to dictate than the other for this chapter, I assume that these melodies differ in their ability to be dictated in some fundamental way when performed in a similar fashion. Additionally, many readers of this dissertation can draw from anecdotal evidence of their own as to how students at various stages of their aural training might fair when asked to dictate both melodies. For some, melody Y might be overwhelmingly difficult. So what? In fact, melody Y might be overwhelmingly difficulty for the vast majority of musicians. Students in particular are quick establish if they believe that a melody they are being tested on is too difficult. From a pedagogical standpoint, we as educators need to be able to know how difficult melodies are to dictate when to our students in order to ensure a degree of fairness when assessing a student’s performance. While of course with each student there are inevitably many variables at play in aural skills instruction ranging from personal abilities, to the goals of the instructor in the scope of their course, there are benchmarks that students are expected to be able to complete throughout their education. As students progress they are expected to be able to dictate more difficult melodies, yet exactly what makes a melody complex and thus difficulty to dicatate is often left to the expertise and intuition of a pedagogue. What I plan on doing In this chapter I examine how tools from computational musicology can be used to help model an aural skills pedagogue’s notion of complexity in melodies. First, I establish that theorists agree on the differences in melodic complexity using results from a small survey of XX aural skills pedagoges. Second, I explore how both static and dynamic computationally derived abstracted features of melodies can be used to approximate an aural skills pedagogue’s intuition. Third and finally, I use evidence afforded by research in computational musicology to posit that the distributional patterns in a corpus of music can be strategically employed to create a more linear path to success among students of aural skills. I demonstrate how by combining evidence from the statistical learning hypothesis, the probabilistic prediction hypothesis, and a newly posited distributional frequency hypothesis, can explain why some musical sequences in a melody of a certain complexity are easier to dictate than others. Using this logic, I then create a new compendium of short melodies, sorted by their perceptual complexity, that can be used for teaching applications. 4.2 Agreeing on Complexity Content matters, as does order Returning to melodies X and Y from above, an aural skills pedagogue most likely has an intution to which of the two melodies X or Y would be easier to dictate. Melody X exhibits a predictiable melodic synatax and phrase structure, the chromatic notes resovle within the conventions of the Common Practice period, and many of the melodic motives outline and imply a harmony based on tertian harmony. On the other hand, Melody Y’s syntax does not comform the the conventions of the common practice music and does not imply any sort of underlying harmony. The durations of the rhythms appear irregular and the melody implies an uneven phrase structure. Yet both melodies X and Y have the exact same set of notes and rhythms. Though despite these content similarities, it would be safe to assume that melody X is probably much easier to dictate than melody Y assuming both were to be played at the same tempo and instrumentation. People agree on difficulty In fact, aural skills pedagoges tend to agree for the most part on questions of difficulty of dication. To demonstrate this, I surveyed XX aural skills pedagogues who have all taught at least two years of aural skills at the University level asking them questions presented in TABLE X on a sample of XX melodies found in the a commonly used sight-singing text book (Berkowitz 2011). The survey had questions that specficially were designed to gauge their appropriateness for use in a melodic dictation context. Questions included: Table 1. What semester of Aural Skills do you think this melody is appropriate for? 2. How many times do you think this melody should be played considering the difficulty you noted in your previous question? 3. Please rate how difficult you believe this melody to be for the average second year undergradaute at your institution using the slider provided. A 0 should indicate ‘Very Easy’ and a 100 should indicate ‘Almost impossible’. 4. In your own subjective opinion, how musical do you believe this melody to be? 5. Is this melody familiar to you? Creating the survey I… * Who it was sent out to (participants) - current institution - age of instructor - number of years teaching aural skills - fixed vs moveeable do vs la based minor - Instrument most amount of professional training on - Degree (Theory, performance) * Asked X questions - see table - melodies came from Berkowitz textbook - sampled 15 melodies from 481 - Overall, the sample exhibited a _____ degree of inter-rater reliability as measured by THIS STATISTICX14 Plotting the respondant’s answers across the textbook the melodies were taken from, with the book progressing from less to more difficult, there is a trend among pedagoges to AGREE ON THE SIMPLER ONES THEN HAVE MORE DIAGREEMENT LATER ON? Central to my argument is a VERY LINEAR TREND of rating of complexity that correlate with both PAGE NUMBER from the textbook that it was drawn from, as well as an even better fitting model of THE EXACT NUMBER OF THE MELODY. Charts on that here MORE DISCUSSION HERE AFTER LOOKING AT DATA. Taken together, both anecdotal and evidence for this survey suggest that aural skills pedagoges tend to agree on how difficult a melody is for use in an aural skills setting. This sense of difficutly or complexity tracks as the book progresses, but to attribute the cause of a melody being difficult as its position in the book would be making a pretty hilarious error. The rest of this chapter investigates how computaionally derrived tools can help inform aural skills pedagogy. In order to provide a sense of validity to the measure, I use the expert answers from the survey as the ground truth for the computational models.15 4.3 Modeling Complexity What is complexity? The ability to quantify what theorists generally agree to be melodic complexity depends on distilling complexity into its component parts. Earlier, when comparing melodies X and Y, some of the features put forward that might contribute to this measure were features such as note density, the melody’s rhythm, what scale the melody draws its notes from, and how tonal the melody might be percieved. Some combination of these component features presumably make up the construct of complexity. History of complexity from melodies Attempting to use features of a melody to to predict how well a melody is remembered has a long history. In 1933, Ortmann put forward a set of melodic determinants that he asserted predicted how well a melody was remembered. These features such as a melody’s repeition, pitch-direction, contour (conjunct-disjunct motion), degree, order, and implied harmony (chord structure) were deemed to affect the melody’s ability to be remembered (Ortmann 1933). Pedagoges since Ortmann such as (Pembrook 1986; Taylor and Pembrook 1983) have expanded on this research and concluded that ________. Not only have researchers in music education attempted to quantify complexity, but work this type of work appears in music psychology. Harrisoon etal 2016 References from Harrison Baker 2017 Each of these examples operationalizes some feature of the melody with a numberical stand in. These features are often refered to as abstracted features. An abstracted feature can be either a quantitative or qualitiative observable feature of a melody that is assumed to be perceptually salient to the listener. Abstracted features are often difficult to quantify with the traditional tools of music analysis. Often, these abstracted features come inspired from other domains like computational linguistics. To given an example of an abstracted feature, perhaps one of the most popular features in recent decades is the normalized pairwise variability index or nPVI. The nPVI began as a measure of rhythmic variablility in langauge (Grabe, n.d.). Shown below, the nPVI quantifies the amount of durational variability in language. It works by comparing the variabilty of vowle lenght compared to syllable length \\[\\nPVI = 100 * [\\sum_{k=1}^{m-1} | \\frac{d_k - d_{k+1}}{(d_k + d_{k+1})/2}/(m-1)] \\] where M is the nubmer of vowels in an utterance and dk is th durtaiotn of the kth item. (VanHandel and Song 2010) In lingusitics, the nPVI has been used to deliniate quantiatve differces between stress and syllable timed langauges. Recenlty in the past decade, music science researchers have used the nPVI to attempt to investigate claims about the relationship between speeach and laguage [Daniele and Patel (2004); Patel and Daniele (2003); VanHandel and Song (2010); DAN PAPER W KV]. While results are mixed regarding the nPVI’s predictive ability and some people argue against nPVI (Deconstructing the nPVI: A Methodological Critique of the nPVI as Applied to Music When it comes out), it does serve as a very good example of a comuputationall derrived measure. Just like summerizing the range of a melody by subtracting the distance between the lowest and highest notes, the nPVI summerizes a phrase and importantly assumes that this measure is representive of the entire phrase the calcuation was performed upon. Getting into Features In computational musicology, these features of melodies can generally be classified into two main types: static and dynamic features. Static features compute a summary measure over the entire melody while dynamic features calculate values for each event onset in a melody. One of the most complete set of static computational measures as applied to music perception come from Daniel Mullensiefens’ Feature ANalysis Technology Acessing STatistics (In a Corpus) or FANTASTIC toolbox (Mullensiefen 2009). According to FANTATIC’s techncial report, “FANTASTIC is a program…that analyzes melodies by computing features The aim is to characterise a melody or a melodic phrase by a set of numerical or categorical values reflecting different aspects of musical structure. This feature representation of melodies can then be applied in Music Information Retrieval algorithms or computational models of melody cognition.” (pp. 4) Drawing from fields both central and perphircal to music science, FANTASTIC computes a collection of 38 features to analyze features of melodies and joined a large and continuing tradition of analyzing music computationally (Lomax 1977 , 1977; Eerola, Louhivuori, and Lebaka 2009; Huron 1994; Lartillot and Toiviainen 2007; McFee et al. 2015; Steinbeck 1982). Addittionally, FANTASATIC also provides a framework for comparing the features of a melody with a parent corpus from which the melody belongs. Back to Aural and applications Returning to the Aural Skills classroom, many of these features can be used to approximate the intutions of complexity as agreed upon by theorists. Below, I SHOW A SERIES OF PLOTS WHERE the continously measured abstracted features of FANTASTIC are plotted against the measures of perceieved complexity and difficulty of expert aural skills pedagoges with their respective correlations in TABLE X. GIANT FIGURE HERE GIANT TABLE HERE From this, it becomes evident that some features like __________ and ________ succede quite well in approximating the rated complexity measures, while others like __________ and ________ do not. I suggest that the reasons that ________ measures are sucessful in explainig is because ___________________. In modeling this problem univariatly, it quicly becomes evident that no single static measure from FANTASTIC is able to complete mirror that of the complexity measrues. Following past research (Baker and Müllensiefen 2017; Harrison, Musil, and Müllensiefen 2016), in order to get a more accurate measure of complexity that mirrors a theorist’s intution, it is possible to use principle components analysis to combine several measures of complexity into one single measure. One reason this approach has been sucessful in the past computatational literature is that many of the abstracted features output by FANTASTIC are collinear. Pratically, this means that it is very hard to change one aspect of a melody without affecting others. Due to the high degree of collinearity, it then becomes possible to reduce the amont of dimensions in the data and begin to approximate this notion of complexity. – Regression ups R2 hopefully Given the increase in model prediction, Hopefully at this point, I can make the argument that I am getting quite close at fully explaining the variance in ratings. Finally, using the features of FANTASTIC, I can also use a random forrest method (LIKE THESE DANIEL PAPERS) to use some machine learning methods to see what best explains this data. USING A …. details of Random Forrest here…… And importanly….. Variable imporacne plot which works by running multiple models and seeing how much variance is accounted for when the model is left out. We see that X Y Z are of highest importance, and this corroborates literature from other FANTASTIC measures that say XYZ. This is important for pedagogy, this can be used to help provide objective measure of difficulty. Can also be a starting point for work on linking these various features with listener response. And thus help people desgin curricula and also then better understand human pecerception and role of melody in the aural skills clasroom. Though while sucessful at modeling, using various linear combinations of these static abstracted features still assumes that listerns experience melodies in some sort of perceptual suspended animation. In order to have more phenomenologically approriate model that incorporates computainoally derived features, it is important to turn to dynamic models of music perception. 4.3.1 Dynamic The Information Dynamic of Muscic (IDyOM) model of Marcus Pearce is a computational model of auditory cognition (Pearce 2018). IDyOM works by …. (M. T. Pearce and Wiggins 2012a; Pearce 2005, 2018) Unlike measures from FANTASTIC, that calculate summary statistics on melodies, IDyOM works by calculating the expectancy of an event based on parameters that it was trained on. As mentioned in Chapter 1, IDyOM is based both on the statistical learning hypothesis and probabilistic prediction hypothesis. According to Pearce, the Statistical Learning Hypotheis states that: musical enculturation is a process of implicit statistical learning in which listeners progressively acquire internal models of the statistical and structural regularities present in the musical styles to which they are exposed, over short (e.g., an individual piece of music) and long time scales (e.g., an entire lifetime of listening). p.2 (Pearce, 2018) The logic here is that the more an individual is exposed musical material, the more they will implicitly understand it which leads the corroborating probabilistic prediction hypothesis which states: while listening to new music, an enculturated listener applies models learned via the SLH to generate probabilistic predictions that enable them to organize and process their mental representations of the music and generate culturally appropriate responses. p.2 (Pearce, 2018). Given the fact that IDyOM makes its calculations based on a series of n-grams that the model is trained on, IDyOM is able to output measures of expectedness for each symbolic token used in its calculations. As detailed in a summary review article on IDyOM by Pearce, the has been sucessful at modeling accurately Western listeners’ melodic pitch expectations in behavioral, physiological, and electroencephalography (EEG) studies using a range of experimental designs, including the probe-tone paradigm visually guided probe-tone paradigm a gambling paradigm, continuous expectedness ratings, and an implicit reaction-time task to judgments of timbral change. Additionally, Peace notes some of IDyOM sucesses in modeling beyond expectation, including sucesses in modeling emotional experiences in music, recognition memory, perceptual similarity, phrase boundary perception and metrical inference. Importnatly, Pearce also claims that A sequence with low IC is predictable and thus does not need to be encoded in full, since the predictable portion can be reconstructed with an appropriate predictive model; the sequence is compressible and can be stored efficiently. Conversely, an unpredictable sequence with high IC is less compressible and requires more memory for storage. Therefore, there are theoretical grounds for using IDyOM as a model of musical memory. Peace notes four studies (Bartlett and Dowling, n.d.; Cohen, Cuddy, and Mewhort 1977; Cuddy and Lyons 1981; Halpern, Bartlett, and Dowling 1995) that show that more complex melodies are more difficult to hold in memory. This theoretical assertion and select empirical findings have important ramifications for the aural skills classroom. In a dictation setting, melodies that are more expected should tax memory less, thus making them easier to remember and dictate. If I assume that more expected melodies are easier to remember, then it follows that the informaiton content measures of expectedness can then be used in melodic memory. Taken together with the above statistcal learning hypothesis and probabilistic prediction hypotheiss, I then put forward a new hypotheis: the frequency facilitaiton hypotheisis. 4.4 Frequency Facilitation Hypothesis Define Logic The frequency facilitation hypotheis makes two important assumptions that rely on both the statistical learning hypotheisis and the perceptual facilitaiton hypothesis. The first is that humans learn melodies via the means predicted by the statistical learning hypothesis. Melodic informaiton that people are exposed to more frequently will be more expected. This assertion results from the probabilistic prediciton hypothesis. Thus, given a sequence any set of notes, the frequency facilitation hypothesis posits that the effeciency in which a melody is processed in memory is related propoational to its degree of expetedness when quantified in information content. From this hypothesis generates a series of testiable predcitions that can be investigated to verify its versimilitude. The first is that melodic patterns that occur more frequently in a corpus will be be easier to remember than those occuring less frequenlty. To test this, we can look at various series of n-grams in a corpus to see model this. In the following two sections, I explore this assertion and then show how this can be applied in the aural skills classroom. 4.4.1 Distributional Patterns in Corpus In order to test this prediction, I extracted a set ten examples of bi, tri, quint, grams from a corpus of sight singing melodies intorduced in the next chapter. Ten examples of each n-gram were sampled from the top and bottom 10% of the n-grams distribution in the corpus. The query was conducted by first translating the entire corpus to sofedge degrees, cleaned of GLiD, and meta information, then summarized. Code used to generate the query can be found in the dissertation appendix. The melodies are plotted in TABLE X Gram Melody Low Frequnecy High Frequency 2 Name Melody Melody 2 Name Melody Melody 2 Name Melody Melody 2 Name Melody Melody 2 Name Melody Melody 3 Name Melody Melody 3 Name Melody Melody 3 Name Melody Melody 3 Name Melody Melody 3 Name Melody Melody 5 Name Melody Melody 5 Name Melody Melody 5 Name Melody Melody 5 Name Melody Melody 5 Name Melody Melody From the table, we can use intutiion to say that in the context of C Major, melodies appearing in the high frequency column might b easier to remember and dictate, especially in the context of Karpinksi’s short-term musical memory than those in the low frequency table. These melodies could also be used then in a testing stituion. Write here about behavioral experiment to do that???? 4.4.2 Memory Facilitation Predictions here OR add in mini experiment that will be test for ISMIR paper. go for further psychology experiemnts in this, lays basis for the computational model and more direct pedagogical applicaitons are discussed below 4.4.3 Peagogical applcation So given the veracity of the frequency facilitaiton hypothesis, how might this information (derrived from comptuaitonal measures) be implemented in the classrom? State the general problem In my experience as an Aural Skills pedagogue, students often belive that the problem with aural skills is that it progresses too quickly. Miriam Idea Can use static features of a melody to gauge difficulty But really could also reorganize melodies based on cumulative IC (which IDyOM gives) Actually, if I do that, is this just overall best model fit to talk about music theorist intution? But in addition to re-sorting melodies as ecological, could also use them as small gorups these could be then sorted based on small chunks and used in progressive loading Even follow IRT modeling and create adaptive testing for app or wahtever (hello post doccc) I give an example of this in Appedix Train corpus on all tonal melodies, then extract out ever n-gram then sort them Creates giant combinatorial explosion of melodic snippets descend arragned by IC Students could eventually learn this in order then would feel like they are not overloaded Futre work would also maybe pit two ways of treating arual skills against each other Just ecological Just snippet combintaiotn of two as supplment This is also now a serious path of inquiry for music peception resrach imo 4.5 Chapter Conclusions In this chapter I have demonstrated how tools from computational musicology can be used as an aide in aural skills pedagogy. After first establishing the extent to which aural skills pedagogues on various melody parameters, I then show how two families of computationally derrived features can stand in for a pedaguges intution. First, using the FANTASTIC toolbox, I show how different combintations of static abstracted features can help explain theorists agreed upon complexity. This first will help with selection of melodies and also provides insights as to which features of the melodies contribute most to percieved difficutly. Second, I demonstrated how assumptions derived from the IDyOM framework can serve as a basis for the intutions of why smaller sequences of notes within melodies are more or less difficult to dictate. Using the logic that sequences that are easier to process are more expected, and that computed measures of information content can be used as a proxy for memory, I show that it follows that given the sequence of an N lenght melody, the ease of dictaiton that it loads on memory is relative to both its degree of expectednes quantified in terms of informaiton content and link it back to hte corpus by linking THAT to it’s n-gram distribbutional freuqency. This chain of thinking then allowed me to put forward a new sequence of melody segments that can be arragned, like other theory textbooks, in terms of their increasing complexiy. I argue that using this smaller, snippit approach, will allow students to not be overwhelmed in their learning by taking a more linear path to dictation, before moving on to more more ecologically valid melodies. I finish by disucssiong how this might be implemented in the classroom. References "],
["hello-corpus.html", "Chapter 5 Hello, Corpus 5.1 Introduction 5.2 Rationale", " Chapter 5 Hello, Corpus 5.1 Introduction Important for music research to have new data Corpora are important In this chapter I introduce a new corpus of sight singing materials from Berkowitz. Contains melodies composed for SS, contains melodies form literature. Demonstrate this by comparing various features in this corpus with essen with tools of last chapter. Imporantly, reperesents set of implicitly held musical undersanding. End with discussion following London of “representative corpus” People can now use this corpus for a lot of things. 5.2 Rationale Corpus work helps inform how we see the world bc it generalizes. This was first done in linguistics. Paragraph here on gw book. Note that there is general split between sylometery studies and using it for NLP. Similar paths were taken in music. We have the MP trajectory that he outlines. Many of the early studies just summerise. Though they are largely situated in Meyer idea that genre is complex system of relations. COmputational musicology needs corpora Here is a history of that And it’s important for this to be representative What do i think rrepresntaive means In this chapter I introduce new SS corpus. Give basic summary statistics on the corpus. Compare it as a corpus to essen. After make argument about two different types of corpora, say we have implicit If it is implicit, follows that there should be some sort of overlap kind of like a markov chain and leonard meyer. Point is to introduce corpus Origin outside music, current state IN music, limitations Describe features of music in corpus Compare it to the features in the Essen Collection Interesting point here is the scoping between what a corpsu represents. On one side we can have the collected works of a dead musician. Something like all of the trumpet solos of clifford brown. Basically have a population here, tho incomplete. Theoretically could have all the studio recordings, transcribe them, total collection. While we could sample from this, problem is that the set is finite. There is no recreating of more clifford brown solos since he died. Could further zoom out and look at a genre. This is very much like the Nick cook chopin studies. Mirrored here with Shanahan’s Debussy studies. Also shanahan chord change studies Idea here is that you are looking for changes over time. But again with clifford, can’t really re-do the 20th century. Maybe find one or two more tunes, but no way to re write cultural conceptions. Almost tautologically we have kept what we wanted and used that for our definition. Zooming out even further we have corpora like the Essen Collection. here it is meant to be represntitive of folk songs of Europe. Presumably this is also bounded by space and time And it begs the question of should songs today be added to the Essen collection? What does this corpus actually represent? Societal conception of what our prototypes might derrive from? Or Colleciton of folk songs for historical purposes? (Ala lomax, bartok, whatever) At this level, represents the genre or style. We see this assumption that these collections or styles are representing something we implicitly have in the work of MP IDyOM. He trains his auditory computational model of cognition on a corpus that is limited in space and time, but then generalizes those probabilities into human behavior. And the thing is that they are very sucessful. We can look at the many things from Pearce 2018 where IDyOM is able to get it right. Western, Jazz, Chinese music. So knowing that there is a move from the single dead composer to a cognitive conception of style. Would be good to have digital representaitons of sytles in brain. Could argue that sight singing melodies in the bel canto tradition follow this. Of course there is cultural baggage with it. But as stated in previous chapters, lots of people do sight singing and sight reading. And these melodies presumably come from the same culture they train musicians for, Interesting question as what it would mean to add a batch of sgiht sininging melodies ot other corpora. But here it is, a corpus of XXX melodies. 5.2.1 Why I don’t follow a random sampling method Also I will explicitly say here I don’t follow a random sampling method as perscribed by London. In his article comes to the conclusion that 300 or so pieces is needed for representive sample. Show how the cannon needs to be connected to something perceptual. ** LONDON OF WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE REPRESENTIVE – london suggests 300 pieces for classical music representation – says that the point is the build a corpus that is “broadly representative of the classical composers, styles, and genres that are most familiar to the 21st century listener.” – says that this then comes from what we hear — JL deliniates between passive and active consumption – point is that these sources “reflect our musical environment” – the implicit assumption being that works outside this sampling would be described as not belonging, but is that not really just a not natural category since if we were to decide that it did belong, it would get lumped in? Clearly the deliniating point here is that of questions of musical similarity and questions of musical similarity are questions of subjectivity. So have to realize with this loop that unless we can additionally provide external evidence that melodies are perceptually different, hard to maintain the borders of what the corpus represents. – Also does this take into account that the listener would change based on exposure and training – get direct and indirect uses of classical music and sample from that – def notes problems in sampling esp w value judgments and lenght of recordings Matthews (2009) – looking at american programming Burden of learning to play the piece in terms of diversity?&gt;?

Abstract Despite its abundance in curricula in music conservatory settings, research on topics pertaining to aural skills is currently limited at best. While anthologies of materials for sight singing and dictation exist, the ways in which people learn melodies are not well understood. This problem is difficult to tackle given the amount of factors that may contribute to the process, such as the complexity of the melody, the degree of exposure needed to commit a melody to long-term memory, and individual differences in cognitive ability that have been shown to contribute to an individual’s performance on musical tasks. Fortunately, literature exists in related areas that serve to inform which parameters might contribute to an individual’s performance in a melodic dictation setting. This paper presents findings from an experiment (N=39) modeling performance on melodic dictation tasks using both individual and musical features. Results suggest tools from computational musicology as well as individual difference measures need further exploration in order to assess the degree to which various features contribute to melodic dictation performance and inform pedagogical practices. 6.1 Introduction 6.1.1 Clearly many factors contribte to this whole thing and need to be taken into a model 6.1.2 Dictation is basically a within subjects design Experiment 6.1.2.1 Get very ecological and dirty and run it Despite its near ubiquity in Conservatory and School of Music curricula, research surrounding topics concerning aural skills is not well understood. This is peculiar since almost any individual seeking to earn a degree in music usually must enrol in multiple aural skills classes which cover a wide array of topics from sight-singing melodies, to melodic and harmonic dictation– all of which are presumed to be fundamental to any musician’s formal training. Skills acquired in these classes are meant to hone the musician’s ear and enable them not only to think about music, but, to borrow Gary Karpinski’s phrase, to “think in music” (Karpinski, 2000, p.4). The tacit assumption behind these tasks is that once one learns to think in music, these abilities should transfer to other aspects of the musician’s playing in a deep and profound way. The skills that make up an individual’s aural skills encompass many abilities, though are thought to be reflective of some sort of core skill. This is evident in early attempts to model performance in aural skills classes where C. S. Harrison, Asmus, and Serpe (1994) created a latent variable model to predict an individual’s success in aural skills classes based on musical aptitude, musical experience, motivation, and academic ability. While their model was able to predict a large amount of variance (73%), modeling at this high, conceptual of a level does not provide any sort of specific insights into the mental processes that are required for completing aural skills related tasks. This trend can also be seen in more recent research that has explored the relationship between how well entrance exams at the university level are able to predict success later on in the degree program. Wolf and Kopiez (2014) noted a multiple confounds in their study attempting to asses ability level in university musicians such as inflated grading, which led to ceiling effects, as well as a broad lack of consistency in how schools are assessing success within their students. But even if the results at the larger level were to be clearer, again this says nothing about the processes that contribute to tasks like melodic dictation. Rather than taking a bird’s eye view of the subject, this chapter will primarily focus on factors that might contribute to an individual’s ability dictate a melody. – note here on not causal, still descriptive to foreshadwo next chatpter Melodic dictation is one of the central activities in an aural skills class. The activity normally consists of the instructor of the class playing a monophonic melody a limited number of times and the students must use both their ears, as well as their understanding of Western Music theory and notation, in order to transcribe the melody without any sort of external reference. No definitive method is taught across universities, but many schools of thought exist on the topic and a wealth of resources and materials have been suggested that might help students better complete these tasks (Berkowitz, Frontier, &amp; Kraft, 1960; Cleland &amp; Dobrea-Grindahl, 2013; Karpinski, 2007; Ottman, 1996). The lack of consistency could be attributed to the fact that there are so many processes at play during this process. Prior to listening, the student needs to have an understanding of Western music notation at least to the degree of understanding of the melody being played. This understanding needs to be readily accessible, since as new musical information is heard, it is the student’s responsibility to, in that moment, encode the melody into either hold a chunk of the melody in short term memory or pattern match to long term memory so that they can identify what they are hearing and transcribe it moments later into Western notation. So no matter what, performing some sort of aural skills task requires both long term memory and knowledge for comprehension, as well as the ability to actively manipulate differing degrees of complex musical information in real time while concurrently writing it down. Given this complexity of the task, as well as the difficulty in quantifying attributes of melodies, it is then not surprising that scant research exists on describing these tasks. Fortunately, a fair amount of research exists in related literature which can generate theories and hypotheses explaining how individuals dictate melodies. Beginning first with factors that are less malleable from person to person would be individual differences in cognitive ability. While dictating melodies is something that is learned, a growing body of literature suggests that other factors can explain unique amounts of variance in performance via differences in cognitive ability. For example, Meinz and Hambrick (2010) found that measures of working memory capacity (WMC) were able to explain variance in an individual’s ability to sight read above and beyond that of sight reading experience and musical training. Colley, Keller, and Halpern (2017) recently suggested an individual’s WMC also could help explain differences beyond musical training in tasks related to tasks of tapping along to expressive timing in music. These issues become more confounded when considering other recent work by Swaminathan, Schellenberg, and Khalil (2017) that suggests factors such as musical aptitude, when considered in the modeling process, can better explain individual differences in intelligence between musicians and nonmusicians implying that within the musical population. They claim there is a selection bias that “smarter” people tend to gravitate towards studying music, which may explain some of the differences in memory thought to be caused by music study (Talamini, Altoè, Carretti, &amp; Grassi, 2017). Knowing that these cognitive factors can play a role warrants attention from future researchers on controlling for variables that might that might contribute to this process but are not directly intuitive and have not been considered in much of the past research. This is especially important given recent critique of models that purport to measure cognitive ability but are not grounded in an explanatory theoretical model (Kovacs &amp; Conway, 2016). Memory for Melodies The ability to understand how individuals encode melodies is at the heart of much of the music perception literature. Largely stemming from the work of Bregman (1994), Deutsch and Feroe (1981), and Dowling (1978; 1971) work on memory for melodies has begun to lay the foundation for how people learn melodies. Initial work by Dowling suggested that both key and contour information play a central role in the perception and memory of novel melodies. Interestingly enough, memory for melodies tends to be much worse than memory for other stimuli such as pictures or faces noting that the average area under the ROC curve tends to be at about .7 in many of the studies they reviewed, with .5 meaning chance and 1 being a perfect performance (Halpern and Bartlett, 2010). Halpern and Bartlett also note that much of the literature on memory for melodies primarily used same difference experimental paradigms to investigate individual’s melodic perception ability similar to the paradigm used in Halpern and Mullensiefen (2008). Musical Factors Not nearly as much is known about how an individual learns melodies, especially in dictation setting. The last, and possibly most obvious, variable that would contribute to an individual’s ability to learn and dictate a melody would be the amount of exposure to the melody and the complexity of the melody itself. There is not much research on the first of these two points, other than an approximation of how many times the melody should be played in a dictation setting according to (Karpinski, 2007, p.100) that accounts for chunking as well as the idea that more exposure would lead to more complete encoding. Recently tools have been developed in the field of computational musicology to help with operationalizing how complex melodies are. Both simple and more complex features have been used to model performance in behavioral tasks. For example Eerola, Himberg, Toiviainen, and Louhivuori (2006) found that note density, though not consciously aware to the participants, predicted judgments of human similarity between melodies not familiar to the participants. Harrison, Baker, Oura, Taylor and Pembrook, Ortman Note density would be an ideal candidate to investigate as it is both easily measured and the amount of information that can be currently held in memory as measured by bits of information has a long history in cognitive psychology (Cowan, 2015; Miller, 1956) – Also Marcus. In terms of more complex features, much of the work largely stems from the work of Mullensiefen and his development of the FANTASTIC Toolbox (2009), a few papers have claimed to be able to predict various behavioral outcomes based on the structural characteristics of melodies. For example, Kopiez and Mullensiefen (2011) claimed to have been able to predict how well songs from The Beatles’ album Revolver did on popularity charts based on structural characteristic of the melodies using a data driven approach. Expanding on an earlier study, Mullensiefen and Halpern (2014) found that the degree of distinctiveness of a melody when compared to its parent corpus could be used in order to predict how participants in an old/new memory paradigm were able to recognize melodies. These abstracted features also have been used in various corpus studies (Frieler, Jakubowski, &amp; Mullensiefen, 2015; Jakubowski, Finkel, Stewart, &amp; Mullensiefen, 2017; Janssen, Burgoyne, &amp; Honing, 2017; Rainsford, Palmer and Paine 2017) that again use a machine learning approach in order to explain which of the 38 features that FANTASTIC calculates can predict real-world behavior. In addition to looking at individual features, or sets of features, as predictors, recent work by P. Harrison, Musil, and Mullensiefen (2016), Baker and Mullensiefen (2017) and the aforementioned Mullensiefen and Halpern (2014) study have used data reduction techniques, namely principal component analysis, to take measures that were successful in predicting behavioral outcomes and boil them down into a single measure of complexity that has had predictive power in modeling experimental performance. While helpful and somewhat explanatory, the problem with many of these approaches is that they take a post-hoc data driven approach with the assumption that listeners are even able to abstract and perceive these features. Doing this does not allow for any sort of controlled approach and without experimentally manipulating the parameters, which is then further confounded when using some sort of data reduction technique. – tho link here to other chapter This is understandable seeing as it is very difficult to manipulate certain qualities of a melody without disturbing other features. For example, if you wanted to decrease the “tonalness” of a melody by adding in a few more chromatic pitches, you inevitably will increase other measures of pitch and interval entropy. In order to truly understand if these features are driving changes in behaviour, each needs to be altered in some sort of controlled and systematic way while simultaneously considering differences in training and cognitive ability. – tho what would judea pearl say about the causal diagrams here???? Write text here for second experiment if possible !!! (For MP ) AIMS This paper presents findings from two experiments modeling performance on melodic dictation tasks using both individual and musical features. A pilot study was run (N=11) was used in order to assess musical confounds that might be present in modeling melodic dictation. Results of that pilot study are not reported here. Based on the results of this pilot data, a follow up experiment was conducted to better investigate the features in question. The study sought to answer three main hypotheses: Are all experimental melodies used equally difficult to dictate? To what extent do the musical features of Note Density and Tonalness play a role in difficulty of dictation? Do individual factors at the cognitive level play a role in the melodic dictation process above and beyond musical factors? 6.2 Methods 6.2.1 Participants Participants Forty-three students enrolled at Louisiana State University School of Music completed the study. The inclusion criteria in the analysis included reporting no hearing loss, not actively taking medication that would alter cognitive performance, and individuals whose performance on any task performed greater than three standard deviations from the mean score of that task. Using these criteria two participants were dropped for not completing the entire experiment. Thus, 41 participants met the criteria for inclusion. The eligible participants were between the ages of 17 and 26 (M = 19.81, SD = 1.93; 15 women). Participants volunteered, received course credit, or were paid $10. 6.2.2 Materials Four melodies for the dictation were selected from a corpus of N=115 melodies derived from the A New Approach to Sight Singing aural skills textbook by Berkowitz et. al (2005). Melodies were chosen based on their musical features as extracted via the FANTASTIC Toolbox (Mullensiefen, 2009). After abstracting the full set of features of the melodies, possible melodies were first narrowed down by limiting the corpus to melodies lasting between 9 and 12 seconds and then indexed to select four melodies were chosen that as part of a 2x2 repeated measures design including a high and low tonalness and note density condition. Melodies, as well as a table of their abstracted features can be seen in Table 1 and Figures 1—4. Melodies and other sounds used were encoded using MuseScore 2 using the standard piano timbre and all set to a tempo of quarter = 120 beats per minute and adjusted accordingly based on time signature to ensure they all sounded the same absolute time duration. The experiment was then coded in jsPsych (de Leeuw, 2015) and accesed through a browser offline with high quality headphones. paney 2016 is timing Table 1 Figure 1-4 6.2.3 Procedure Upon arriving at the lab, participants sat down in a lab at their own personal computer. Multiple individuals were tested simultaneously although individually. Each participant was given a test packet which contained all information needed for the experiment. After obtaining written consent participants navigated through a series of instructions explaining the nature of the experiment and given an opportunity to adjust the volume to a comfortable level. The first portion of the experiment that participants completed was the melodic dictation. In order to alleviate any anxiety in performance, participants were explicitly told that “unlike dictations performed in class, they were not expected to get perfect scores on their dictations”. Each melody was played five times with 20 seconds between hearings and 120 seconds after the last hearing. (CITE SIMILAR) After the dictation portion of the experiment, participants completed a small survey on their Aural Skills background, as well as the Bucknell Auditory Imagery Scale C (Halpern, 2015). After completing the Aural Skills portion of the experiment participants completed one block of two different tests of working memory capacity (Unsworth et al., 2005) and Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices and a Number Series task as two tests of general fluid intelligence (Gf) (Raven et al., 1998; Thurstone, 1938) resulting in four total scores. – Cite here that talks about how one round of each is OK? After completing the cognitive battery, participants finished the experiment by compiling the self-report version of the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index (Mullensifen et. al, 2014), the Short Test of Musical Preferences (Rentfrow &amp; Gosling, 2003), as well as questions pertaining to the participants SES, and any other information we needed to control for (Hearing Loss, Medication). Exact materials for the experiment can be found here. 6.2.4 Scoring Melodies Scoring Melodies were scored by counting the amount of notes in the melody and multiplying that number by two. Half the points were attributed to rhythmic accuracy and the other half to pitch accuracy. Points were not deducted for notating the melody in the incorrect octave. Points for pitch could only be given if the participant correctly notated the rhythm. For example, in melody 34 there were 40 points possible (20 notes * 2). If a participant were to have put a quarter note on the second beat of the third measure, and have everything else correct, they would have scored a 19/20. Only if the correct rhythms of the measures were accurate could pitch points be awarded. In cases where there were more serious errors, for example if the second half of the second bar was not notated, points would have been deducted in both the pitch and rhythm sub-scores. Both the first and second author scored all melodies independently and then cross referenced for interrater reliability. – change wording Using a single score intraclass correlation coefficient calculation κ = .96 which suggests a high degree of inter-rater reliability (McHugh, 2012). — discussion on scoring in discussion 6.3 Results 6.3.1 Data Screening Before conducting any analyses data was screened for quality. List wise deletion was used to remove any participants that did not have all variables used in modeling. This process resulted in removing four participants: two did not complete any of the survey materials and two did not have any measures of working memory capacity due to computer error. After list-wise deletion, thirty-nine participants remained. Effects of Melodic Features In order to investigate H1, that melodies would differ in their degree of difficulty based on melodic features, we ran a repeated measures ANOVA using the ez package in R (Lawrence, 2016). Relevant statistics from the model can be seen in Table 2. RM ANOVA TABLE Subsequent models exploring possible exploratory covariance relationships using random slope models that used measures of working memory capacity, general fluid intelligence, and measures of musical training, none of which emerged as significant. Differences between melodies can be see below in Figure 5. FIGRE 5 BOX PLOT 6.4 Discussion Here, we have investigated the extent to which both individual differences and abstracted musical features could be used to model results in melodic dictations. In order to examine H1, we ran a repeated measures ANOVA in order discern any differences in melody difficulty. As noted in Table 2, both a significant main effect of Tonalness and Note Density was found, as well as a small interaction between the two variables suggesting evidence supporting rejecting H2’s null hypothesis. The interaction emerged from differences in melody means in the low density conditions with the melody with higher tonalness actually scoring higher in terms of number of errors. — Add in all music education literature — Get Ortmann While we expected to find an interaction, this condition (Melody 34) was hypothesized to be the easiest of the four conditions. With Melody 9 there was a clear floor effect, which was also to be expected as when we chose the melodies, we had no previous experimental data explicitly looking at melodic dictation to rely on. For future experiments, we will use abstracted features from Melody 9 as a baseline. The main effect of note density was expected and exhibited a large effect size. (ηg = .46). While it would be tempting to attribute this finding exactly to the Note Density feature extracted by FANTASTIC, the high and low density conditions could also be operationalized as having compound versus simple meter. Given the large effect of note density, we plan on taking more careful steps in the selection of our next melodies in order to control for any effects of meter and keep the effects limited to one meter if at all possible. Somewhat surprisingly, the analysis incorporating the cognitive measures of covariance did not yield any significant results. While other researchers have noted the importance of baseline cognitive ability (Schellenberg &amp; Weiss, 2013), the task specificity of doing melodic dictation as we designed the experiment might not be well suited to capture the variability needed for any effects. Hence, this paper would not be able to reject H3’s null hypothesis. Considering that other researchers have founding constructs like working memory capacity and general fluid intelligence to be important factors of tasks of musical perception, a more refined design might be considered in the future to find any sort of effects. Taken as a whole, these findings suggest that aural skills pedagogues should consider exploring the extent to which computationally extracted features can guide the difficulty expected of melodic dictation exercises. Need section on the classroom This paper demonstrates that abstracted musical features such as tonalness and note density can play a role in predicting how well students do in tasks of melodic dictation. While the experiment failed to yield any significant differences in cognitive ability predicting success at the task, our future research plans to continue incorporate measures that others have deemed important. We next plan to replicate this experiment’s design with different melodies that usesimilar features.

["computational-model.html", "Chapter 7 Computational Model 7.1 Levels of Abstraction 7.2 Model Overview 7.3 Verbal Model 7.4 Formal Model 7.5 Conclusions", " Chapter 7 Computational Model 7.1 Levels of Abstraction In his 2007 article Models of Music Similarity (Wiggins 2007), Geraint Wiggins distinguishes between descriptive and explanatory models in describing the modeling of human behavior. Descriptive models assert what will happen in response to an event. For example, as discussed in the previous chapter, as the note density of a melody increases and the tonalness of a melody decreases, a melody may become harder to dictate. While the increase in note density is assumed to drive the decrease in dictation scores, merely stating that there is an established relationship between one variable and the other says nothing about the inner workings of this process. An explanatory model on the other hand not only describes what will happen, but additionally notes why and how this process occurs. For example, much of the work musical expectation demonstrates that as an individual’s exposure to a musical style increases, so does their ability to predict specific events within a given musical texture (Pearce 2018). Not only does more exposure predict more accurate responses, but many of these models of musical expectation derive their underlying predictive power from the brain’s ability to implicitly track statistical regularities in musical perception (Saffran et al. 1999; Margulis 2014). The how derives from the tracking of statistical regularities in musical information and the why derives from evolutionary demands; Organisms that are able to make more accurate predictions about their environment are more likely to survive and pass on their genes (Huron 2006). Wiggins writes that although there can be both explanatory and descriptive theories, depending on the level of abstraction, a theory may be explanatory at one level, yet descriptive at another. Using the mind-brain dichotomy, he asserts that the example of a theory of musical expectation could be explanatory at the level of behavior as noted above, but says nothing about what is happening at the neural level. Both descriptive and explanatory theories are needed: descriptive theories are used to test explanatory theories and by stringing together different layers of abstraction, we can arrive at a better understanding of how the world works. Returning to melodic dictation, under Wiggins’ framework the Karpinski model of melodic dictation (Karpinski 2000, 1990) qualifies as a descriptive model. The model says what happens over the time course of a melodic dictation– specifying four discrete stages discussed in earlier chapters– but does not explicitly state how or why this process happens. In order to have a more complete understanding of melodic dictation, an explanatory model is needed. In this chapter I introduce an explanatory model of melodic dictation. The model is inspired by work from both computational musicology and cognitive psychology. From computational musicology I draw on the work of Marcus Pearce’s IDyOM (Pearce 2005) and from cognitive psychology I draw from Nelson Cowan’s Embedded Process model of working memory (Cowan 1988, 2010) to explain the perceptual components. In addition to quantifying each step, the model incorporates flexible parameters that could be adjusted in order to accommodate individual differences, while still relying on a domain general process. By relying on cognitive mechanisms based in statistical learning, rather than a rule based system for music analysis (Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1986; Narmour 1990, 1992; Temperley 2004) this model allows for the heterogeneity of musical experience among a diversity of music listeners. 7.2 Model Overview The model consists of three main modules, each with its own set of parameters: Prior Knowledge Selective Attention Transcription and Re-entry Inspired by Bayesian computational modeling, the Prior Knowledge module reflects the previous knowledge an individual brings to the melodic dictation. The Selective Attention– somewhat akin to Karpinski’s extractive listening– segments incoming musical information by using the window of attention as conceptualized as the limits of working memory capacity as a sensory bottleneck to constrict the size of musical chunk that an individual could to transcribe. Once musical material is in the focus of attention, the Transcription function pattern matches against the Prior Knowledge’s corpus of information in order to find a match of explicitly known musical information. The Transcription function will recursively truncate what musical information is in Selective Attention if no match is found. In addition to Transcription, there is also a Re-entry function that will restart the entire loop. This process reflects, but does not actually mirror the exact cognitive process used in melodic dictation, yet seems to be phenomenologically similar to the decision making process used when attempting notate novel melodies. Based on both the prior knowledge and individual differences of the individual, the model will scale in ability, with the general retrieval mechanisms in place. The exact details of the assumptions, parameters, and complete formula of the model are discussed below. 7.3 Verbal Model Below I describe my model’s assumptions, parameters, as well as the steps taken when the model is run. After detailing the inner workings of each of the assumptions and the modules, described in roughly the order that they occur, I present the model using psudeocode with the terminology described below. I discuss the issues of assumptions and representations as they arise in describing the model. 7.3.1 Model Representational Assumptions In order to write a computer program that mirrors the melodic dictation process, how the mind perceives and represents about musical information must be defined a priori. Before delving into questions of representation, this model assumes that the musical surface16 as represented by the notes via Western musical notation are salient and can be perceived as distinct perceptual phenomena. Although there is work that suggests that different cultures and levels of experience might not categorize melodic information universally (McDermott et al. 2016), other work suggests that experiencing pitches as discrete, categorical phenomena is categorized as a statistical human universal (Savage et al. 2015). For the purposes of this model I assume that individuals do in fact perceive the musical surface similarly to the written score. Knowing that it is melodic information or melodic data that needs to be represented, the question then becomes what is the best way in which to represent it. This issue becomes increasingly complex when considering literature suggesting that the human mind represents musical information in a variety of different forms (Krumhansl 2001; Levitin and Tirovolas 2009). For the purposes of this model and further examples I choose to represent musical information using both the pitch (note and scale degree) and timing (rhythm and inter-onset-interval) representation described in Pearce (2018). Future research comparing this model’s output using different representations will also contribute to conversations regarding pedagogy in that if one form of data representation mirrors human behavior better than others, it would provide more than evidence in support of the pedagogy of one system over another. How the model represents musical information is the first important parameter value that needs be chosen before running the model and this establishes the Prior Knowledge. 7.3.2 Contents of the Prior Knowledge The Prior Knowledge consists of a corpus of digitally represented melodies taken to reflect the implicitly understood structural patterns in a musical style that the listener has been exposed to. The logic of representing an individual’s prior knowledge follows the assumptions of both the Statistical Learning Hypothesis (SLH) and the Probabilistic Prediction Hypothesis (PPH), both core theoretical assumptions of the Information Dynamic of Music (IDyOM) model of Marcus Pearce (Pearce 2005, 2018). Using a corpus of melodies to represent an individual’s prior knowledge relies on the Statistical Learning Hypothesis which states: musical enculturation is a process of implicit statistical learning in which listeners progressively acquire internal models of the statistical and structural regularities present in the musical styles to which they are exposed, over short (e.g., an individual piece of music) and long time scales (e.g., an entire lifetime of listening). p.2 (Pearce, 2018) The logic here is that the more an individual is exposed musical material, the more they will implicitly understand it which leads the corroborating probabilistic prediction hypothesis which states: while listening to new music, an enculturated listener applies models learned via the SLH to generate probabilistic predictions that enable them to organize and process their mental representations of the music and generate culturally appropriate responses. p.2 (Pearce, 2018). Taken together and then quantified using Shannon information content (Shannon 1948), it then becomes possible using the IDyOM framework to have a quantifiable measure that reliably predicts the amount of perceived unexpectedness in a musical melody that can change pending on the musical corpus that the model is trained on. As a model IDyOM has been successful mirroring human behavior in melodies in various styles (Pearce 2018), harmony– outperforming (Harrison and Pearce 2018) sensory models of harmony (Bigand et al. 2014)–, and is also being developed to handle polyphonic materials (Sauve 2017). Stepping beyond the assumptions of IDyOM, the prior knowledge also needs to have a implicit/explicitly known parameter which indicates whether or not an pattern of music– or n-gram17 pattern– is explicitly learned. This threshold can be set relative to the entire distribution of all n-grams in the corpus. 7.3.3 Modeling Information Content Having established that the models’ first parameters to be decided are the representation of strings and the implicit/explicit threshold, the next decision that has to be made is how the model decides segmentation for the second stage of Selective Attention. Although there has been a large amount of work on different ways to segment the musical surface using rule based methods (Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1986; Margulis 2005; Narmour 1990, 1992), which rely on matching a music theorist’s intuition with a set of descriptive rules somewhat like the boundary formation rules put forward in A Generative Theory of Tonal Music, as noted by Pearce (Pearce 2018), rule based models often fail at when applied to music outside the Western art music canon. Additionally, since melodic dictation is an active memory process, rather than a semi-passive process of listening, this model needs to be able to quantify musical information on two conditions. The first is that it must be dependent on prior musical experience. The second is that it should allow for a movable boundary for selective attention so that musical information that is memory can be actively maintained while carrying out another cognitive process, that of notating the melody. In order to create this metric, I rely on IDyOM’s use of information content (Shannon 1948) which quantifies the information content of melodies based on corpus of materials. For example, when trained against a corpus of melodies, this excerpt in Figure 7.1 from the fourth movement of Schubert’s Octet in F Major (D.803) lists the information content of the excerpt calculated for each note atop the notation18 Appearing in Figure 7.2, I plot the cumulative information content of the melody, along with both an arbitrary threshold for the limits of working memory capacity and where the subsequent segmentation boundary for musical material to be put in the Selective Attention buffer would be. These values chosen show a small example of how the Selective Attention module works. The advantage of operationalizing how an individual hears a melody like this is that melodies with lower information content, derived from an understanding of having more predictable patterns from the corpus, will allow for larger chunks to be put inside of the selective attention buffer. Additionally, individuals with higher working memory capacity would be able to take in more musical information. Figure 7.1: Cadential Excerpt from Schubert’s Octet in F Major Figure 7.2: Cumulative Information in Schubert Octet Excerpt It is important to highlight that the notes above the melody here are dependent on what is current in the Prior Knowledge module. A corpus of Prior Knowledge with less melodies would lead to higher information content measures for each set of notes, while a prior knowledge that has extensive tracking of the patterns would lead to lower information content. This increase in predictive accuracy mathematically reflects the intuition that those with more listening experience can process greater chunks of musical information. 7.3.4 Setting Limits with Transcribe With each note then quantified with a measure of information content, it then becomes possible to set a limit on the maximum amount of information that the individual would be able to hold in memory as defined by the Selective Attention module. A higher threshold would allow for more musical material to be put in the attentional buffer, and a lower threshold would restrict the amount of information held in an attentional buffer. By putting a threshold on this value, this serves as something akin to a perceptual bottleneck based on the assumption that there is a capacity limit to that of working memory (Cowan 1988, 2010). Modulating this boundary will help provide insights into the degree to which melodic material can be retained between high and low working memory span individuals. In practice, notes would enter the attentional buffer until the information content from the melody is equal to the memory threshold. At this point, the notes that are in the attentional buffer are segmented and will be actively maintained in the Selective Attention buffer. In theory, the maximum of the attentional buffer should not be reached since the individual performing the dictation would still need mental resources and attention to actively manipulate the information in the attentional buffer for the process of notating. 7.3.5 Pattern Matching With subset of notes of the melody represented in the attentional buffer, whether or not the melody becomes notated depends on whether or not the melody or string in the buffer can be matched with a string that is explicitly known in the corpus. Mirroring a search pattern akin to Cowan’s Embedded Process model (Cowan 1988, 2010), the individual would search across their long term memory, or Prior Knowledge for anything close to or resembling the pattern in the Selective Attention buffer. Cowan’s model differs from other more module based models of working memory like those of Baddeley and Hitch (1974) by positing that working memory should be conceptualized as a small window of conscious attention. As an individual directs their attention to concepts represented in their long term memory, they can only spotlight a finite amount of information where categorical information regarding what is in the window of attention not far from retrieval. An example of this bottle necking is given after a formal statement of the model. Using this logic, longer pattern strings n-grams would be less likely to be recalled exactly since they occur less frequently in the prior knowledge. When searching for a pattern match, the Transcription module is at work. If a pattern match that has been moved to Selective Attention is immediately found, the contents of Selective Attention would be considered to be notated. The model would register that a loop had taken place and document the n-gram match. Of course, finding an immediate pattern match each time is highly unlikely and the model needs to be able to compensate if that happens. If a pattern is not found in the initial search that is explicitly known, one token of the n-gram would be dropped off the string and the search would happen again. This recursive search would happen until an explicit long term memory match is made. Like humans taking melodic dictation, the computer would have the best luck finding patterns that fall within the largest density of a corpus of intervals distribution. Additionally, like students performing a dictation, if a student does not explicitly know an interval, or a 2-gram, the dictation would not be able to be completed. If this happens, both the model and student would have to move on to the next segment via the Re-entry function. Eventually there would be a successful explicit match of a string in the Transcription module and that section of the melody would be considered to be dictated. The model here would register that one iteration of the function has been run and the chunk transcribed would then be recorded. After recording this history, the process would happen again starting at either the next note from where the model left off, the note in the entire string with the lowest information content, or n-gram left in the melody with that is most represented in the corpus. This parameter is defined before the model is run and the question of dictation re-entry certainly warrants further research and investigation. This type of pattern search is also dependent on the way that the Prior Knowledge is represented. In the example here, both pitch and rhythmic information are represented in the string. Since there is probably a very low likelihood of finding an exact match for every n-gram with both pitch and rhythm, this pattern search can happen again with both rhythms and pitch information queried separately. If not found, exact pitch-temporal matches are found and the search is run again on either the pitch or rhythmic information separately; this would be computationally akin to Karpinski’s proto-notation that he suggests students use in learning how to take melodic dictation (Karpinski 2000, 88). This feature of the model would predict that more efficient dictations would happen when pitch and interval information is dictated simultaneously. Running the model prioritizing the secondary search with either pitch or rhythmic information will provide new insights into practical applications of dictation strategies. Using this separate search feature as an option of the model seems to match with the intuitions strategies that someone dictating a melody might use. 7.3.6 Dictation Re-Entry Upon the successful pattern match of a string, the Selective Attention and Transcription module would need too then be run again. This process is done via the Re-entry function. As noted above, re-entry in the melody could be a highly subjective point of discussion. The model could either re-enter at the last note where the function successfully left off, the note in the melody with the lowest information content, the n-gram most salient in the corpus, or theoretically any other type of way that could be computationally implemented. Entering at the last note not transcribed is logical from a computational standpoint, but this linear approach seems to be at odds with anecdotal experience. Entering at the note with the lowest information content seems to provide a intuitive point of re-entry in that it would then be easier to transcribe. Entering at the most represented n-gram seems to match the most with intuition in that people would want to tackle the easier tasks first, but this rests on the assumption that humans are able to reliably detect the sections of a melody that are easiest to transcribe based on implicitly learned statistical patterns. For example, some people might instead choose to go to the end of a melody after successful transcription of the start of the melody. This might be because this part of the melody is most active in memory due to a recency effect, or it could be that that cadential gestures are more common in being represented in the prior knowledge. 7.3.7 Completion Given the recursive nature of this process, if all 2-grams are explicitly represented in the Prior Knowledge then the target melody should be transcribed. If only represented using such a small chunk, the model will have to loop over the melody many times, thus indicating that the transcriber had a high degree of difficulty dictating the melody. If there is a gap in explicit knowledge in the prior knowledge, only patches of the melody will be recorded and the melody will not be recorded in its entirety. An easier transcription will result in less iterations of the model with larger chunks. Though the current instantiation of the model does not incorporate how multiple hearings might change how a melody is dictated, one could constrain the process to only allow a certain number of iterations to reflect this. Of course as a new melody is learned it is slowly being introduced into long term memory and could be completely be capable of being represented in long term memory without being explicitly notated at the end of a dictation with time running out and thus not possible to be completed. This of course then would be imposing some sort of experimental constraint on the process and since this is meant to be a cognitive computational model of melodic dictation this caveat would complicate the model. Future research could be done to optimize the choices that the model makes in order to satisfy whatever constraints are imposed and could be an interesting avenue of future research, but are beyond the initial goals of the model. 7.3.8 Model Output The model then outputs each n-gram transcribed and can be counted as a series with less attempts mapping to an easier transcription. I believe that this lines with many intuitions about the process of melodic dictation. It first creates a linear mapping of attempts to dictate with difficulty of the melody. It relies on a distinction between explicit and implicit statistical knowledge. It is based on the Embedded Process Model from working memory and attention, so is part of a larger generative model, giving more credibility that this could be how melodic dictation works. 7.4 Formal Model Below I present the computational model in psudeocode as described in Figure 7.3. First listed are the defined inputs, the functions needed to run the algorithm, and then the sequence the model runs. To aid distinguishing between functions and objects, I put functions in italics and objects in bold. Below the model in Figure 7.4, I provide a brief walk through of one iteration of the model. 7.4.1 Computational Model Figure 7.3: Formal Model 7.4.2 Example Figure 7.4: Model Example The example above shows one iteration of the model run using the musical example from above using a hypothetical corpus for the pattern matching. Using the model above, the following inputs were defined a priori: The Prior Knowledge is a hypothetical corpus of symbolic strings representing all n-grams of melodies The Threshold is set to five exact matches in the Prior Knowledge The WMC is set at 17 The Target Melody is the Schubert excerpt from above The String Position object is used to track the position in the dictation The Difficulty object starts at 0 The Dictation object is NULL to begin, and each new n-gram successfully transcribed is annexed to it Figure 7.4 progresses from left to right over the course of time. The algorithm begins by first running the listen() function on the Target Melody. First the model checks that there are notes to transcribe; this being the first loop of the model, this is statement will be FALSE so the next step is taken. Notes of the Target Melody are read in to the Selective Attention buffer until the information content of the melody exceeds that of the working memory threshold. This is depicted graphically in the leftmost panel of Figure 7.4. Each note unfolding over time fills up the Selective Attention working memory buffer. When the amount of information reaches the perceptual bottleneck– as indicated by the dashed line– the Selective Attention buffer stops receiving information. At this point the model will mark where in the melody it stopped taking in new information for later. Here the contents in Selective Attention are moved to the transcribe() function. With the contents of Selective Attention passed to transcribe(), the model adds one to the counter indicating the first search is about to run. Moving to the middle panel of Figure 7.4, the symbol string of notes in the first column are indexed against the Prior Knowledge. Only if a five note pattern has appeared more than or equal to five times, as determined by the Threshold input, will the corresponding EXPLICIT column be TRUE. In this case, this pattern has occurred over the threshold of 5 and thus a successful match is found. It is at this step that the search resembles that of Cowan’s model of working memory as active attention. The pattern being searched for is compared against a vast amount of information, with cues from the contents of what is in Selective Attention grouping similar patterns together. At the neural level, this is most likely a much more complex process, but to show this grouping I note that this search is at least organized by the first pitch. I assume it would be reasonable that patterns starting on G as \\(\\hat{5}\\)19 might happen together. Since this string does have a TRUE match with EXPLICIT, the contents of Selective Attention are considered notated. At this point the model would record the 5-gram, along with the string that it was matched with. the function would then re-run the listen function via the notateReentry() function at the next point in the melody as tracked by the String Position object. If there were not to have been an exact match, the model would remove one token from the melody and performed the search again on the knowledge of all 4-grams and add one to the Difficulty counter. This process would happen recursively until a match is found. If no match is found in either the complex representation, or that of the two rhythm and pitch corpora, the fifth step of transcribe() would trigger notateReentry() to be run without documenting the n-gram currently being dictated. This would be akin to a student not being able to identify a difficult interval, thus having to restart the melody at a new position. Decisions about re-entry warrant further research and discussion, but this model for the sake of parsimony, assumes linear continuation. As notated in §7.3.5, other modes of re-entry could be incorporated into the model. This looping process would occur again and again until the entire melody is notated. With each iteration of each n-gram notated, the difficulty counter would increase in relation to the representation of that string in the corpus. This provides an algorithmic implementation of a theorist’s intuition that less common n-grams or intervals (2-grams) are going to lead to higher difficulty in dictation. Also worth noting is steps 3 and 4 in the transcribe() function are akin to Karpinski’s proto-notation. Further research might consider advantages in the order of searching the Prior Knowledge corpora. 7.5 Conclusions In this chapter, I presented an explanatory, computational model of melodic dictation. The model combines work from computational musicology and work from cognitive psychology. In addition to being a complete model that explicates every step of the dictation process, the model seems to match phenomenological intuitions as to the process of melodic dictation. Given the current state of the model, it makes predictions about the dictation process and can eventually be implemented and tested against human behavioral data to provide evidence in support of its verisimilitude. For example, the model predicts: Segments of melodies are likely successfully to be dictated relative to the frequency distribution of their prior knowledge. Higher working memory span individuals will be able to dictate bigger chunks of melodies, and thus perform better at dictation Using an atomistic dictation will result not as effective dictations than attempting to identify larger patterns Determining the difficulty of melodies of equal length is predictable from the frequency the melody’s cumulative n-gram distribution. Some atonal melodies will be easier to dictate than tonal melodies if they consist of patterns that are more frequent in a listener’s prior knowledge Higher exposure to sight-singing results in more explicitly learned patterns, thus the ability to identify larger patterns of music Although many of these hypotheses might seem intuitive to any instructor that has taught aural skills before, work from this dissertation provides a theory as to why each appears to be true. Future research beyond this dissertation will explore further predictions of this work in more detail. Most importantly from a pedagogical standpoint, the model and underlying theory gives exact language as to how and why melodic dictation works, which can serve as a valuable pedagogical and research contribution.
